<p>&#8220;Now, look a-here, Alec Lloyd,&#8221; broke in
Hairoil Johnson, throwin&#8217; up one hand like as if
to defend hisself, and givin&#8217; me a kinda scairt
look, &#8220;you shut you&#8217; bazoo right this minute&#8211;and
git! Whenever you begin singin&#8217; that song, I
know you&#8217;re a-figgerin&#8217; on how to marry somebody
off to somebody else. And I just won&#8217;t
have you <i>around!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>We was a-settin&#8217; t&#8217;gether on the track side of
the deepot platform at Briggs City, him
a-holdin&#8217; down one end of a truck, and me the
other. The mesquite lay in front of us, and it
was all a sorta greenish brown account of the
pretty fair rain we&#8217;d been havin&#8217;. They&#8217;s miles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
of it, y&#8217; savvy, runnin&#8217; so far out towards the
west line of Oklahomaw that it plumb slices the
sky. Through it, north and south, the telegraph
poles go straddlin&#8217;&#8211;in the <i>di</i>rection of Kansas
City on the right hand, and off past Rogers&#8217;s
Butte to Albuquerque on the left. Behind us
was little ole Briggs, with its one street of square-front
buildin&#8217;s facin&#8217; the railroad, and a scatterin&#8217;
of shacks and dugouts and corrals and
tin-can piles in behind.</p>

<p>Little ole Briggs! Sometimes, you bet you&#8217;
life, I been pretty down on my luck in Briggs,
and sometimes I been turrible happy; also, I
been just so-so. But, no matter how things pan
out, darned if I cain&#8217;t allus say truthful that
she just about suits me&#8211;that ornery, little, jerkwater
town!</p>

<p>The par<i>ti</i>cular day I&#8217;m a-speakin&#8217; of was a
jo-dandy&#8211;just cool enough to make you want
t&#8217; keep you&#8217; back aimed right up at the sun, and
without no more breeze than &#8217;d help along a
butterfly. Then, the air was all nice and perfumey,
like them advertisin&#8217; picture cards you
git at a drugstore. So, bein&#8217; as I was enjoyin&#8217;
myself, and a-studyin&#8217; out somethin&#8217; as I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
hummed that was <i>mighty</i> important, why, I
didn&#8217;t want t&#8217; mosey, no, ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>But Hairoil was mad. I knowed it fer the
reason that he&#8217;d called me Alec &#8217;stead of Cupid.
Y&#8217; see, all the boys call me Cupid. And I ain&#8217;t
ashamed of it, neither. <i>Some</i>body&#8217;s got t&#8217; help
out when it&#8217;s a case of two lovin&#8217; souls that&#8217;s
bein&#8217; kept apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, pardner,&#8221; I answers him, as coaxin&#8217;
as I could, &#8220;don&#8217;t you go holler &#8217;fore you&#8217;re hit.
It happens that I ain&#8217;t a-figgerin&#8217; on no hitch-up
plans fer <i>you.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil, he stood up&#8211;quick, so that I come
nigh fallin&#8217; offen my end of the truck. &#8220;But
you are fer some <i>other</i> pore cuss,&#8221; he says.
&#8220;You as good as owned up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;I are. But the gent in
question wouldn&#8217;t want you should worry about
<i>him</i>. All that&#8217;s a-keepin&#8217; <i>him</i> anxious is that
mebbe he won&#8217;t git his gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; Hairoil goes on,&#8211;turrible solemn, he
was&#8211;&#8220;I have <i>de</i>cided that this town has had
just about it&#8217;s fill of this Cupid business of
yourn&#8211;and I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I snickered. &#8220;Y&#8217; are?&#8221; I ast. &#8220;Wal, how?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>&#8220;By marryin&#8217; you off. When you&#8217;re hitched
up you&#8217;self, you won&#8217;t be so all-fired anxious t&#8217;
git other pore fellers into the traces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That good news,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Who&#8217;s the for-tu<i>nate</i>
gal you&#8217;ve picked fer me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind,&#8221; answers Hairoil. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a new gal, and she&#8217;ll be along next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she pretty! Say! Pretty ain&#8217;t no name
fer it! She&#8217;s got big grey eyes, with long, black,
sassy winkers, and brown hair that&#8217;s all kinda
curly over the ears. Then her cheeks is pink, and
she&#8217;s got the cutest mouth a man &#8217;most ever
seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, a-course, I thought he was foolin&#8217;. (And
mebbe he was&#8211;<i>then</i>.) A gal like that fer me!&#8211;a fine, pretty gal fer such a knock-kneed, slab-sided
son-of-a-gun as me? I just couldn&#8217;t swaller
<i>that</i>.</p>

<p>But, aw! if I only had &#8217;a&#8217; knowed how that
idear of hisn was a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; grow!&#8211;that idear
of him turnin&#8217; Cupid fer <i>me,</i> y&#8217; savvy. And if
only I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; knowed what a turrible bust-up he&#8217;d
fin&#8217;lly be <i>re</i>sponsible fer &#8217;twixt me and the same
grey-eyed, sassy-winkered gal! If I had, it&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
cinch I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; sit on him <i>hard</i>&#8211;right then and
there.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t, though. I switched back on to what
was a-puzzlin&#8217; and a-worryin&#8217; me. &#8220;Billy Trowbridge,&#8221;
I begun, &#8220;has waited too long a&#8217;ready
fer Rose Andrews. And if things don&#8217;t come
to a haid right soon, he&#8217;ll lose her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil give a kinda jump. &#8220;The Widda
Andrews,&#8221; he says, &#8220;&#8211;Zach Sewell&#8217;s gal? So
you&#8217;re a-plannin&#8217; t&#8217; interfere in the doin&#8217;s of ole
man Sewell&#8217;s fambly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached fer my hand and squz it, and pretended
t&#8217; git mournful, like as if he wasn&#8217;t never
goin&#8217; t&#8217; see me again. &#8220;My <i>pore</i> friend!&#8221; he
says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, what&#8217;s eatin&#8217; you now?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;&#8211;only that pretty gal I tole you
about, she&#8217;s<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>

<p>He let go of my hand, shrug his shoulders,
and started off. &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he called back.
&#8220;Let it drop. We&#8217;ll just see. Mebbe, after all,
you&#8217;ll git the very lesson you oughta have. Ole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
man Sewell!&#8221; And, shakin&#8217; his haid, he turned
the corner of the deepot.</p>

<p>Wal, who was Sewell anyhow?&#8211;no better&#8217;n
any other man. I&#8217;d knowed him since &#8217;fore the
Oklahomaw Rushes, and long &#8217;fore he&#8217;s wired-up
half this end of the Terrytory. And I&#8217;d knowed
his oldest gal, Rose, since she was knee-high to
a hop-toad. Daisy gal, she allus was, by thunder!
And mighty sweet. Wal, when, after tyin&#8217;
up t&#8217; that blamed fool Andrews, she&#8217;d got her
matreemonal hobbles off in less&#8217;n six months&#8211;owin&#8217;
t&#8217; Monkey Mike bein&#8217; a little sooner in
the trigger finger&#8211;why, d&#8217;you think I was
a-goin&#8217; to stand by and see a tin-horn proposition
like that Noo York Simpson put a vent
brand on her? <i>Nixey!</i></p>

<p>It was ole man Sewell that bossed the first job
and cut out Andrews fer Rose&#8217;s pardner. Sewell&#8217;s
that breed, y&#8217; know, hard-mouthed as a
mule, and if he cain&#8217;t run things, why, he&#8217;ll take
a duck-fit. But he shore put his foot in it <i>that</i>
time. Andrews was as low-down and sneakin&#8217; as
a coy<i>o</i>te, allus gittin&#8217; other folks into a fuss if
he could, but stayin&#8217; outen range hisself. The
little gal didn&#8217;t have no easy go with him&#8211;we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
all knowed <i>that,</i> and she wasn&#8217;t happy. Wal,
Mike easied the sittywaytion. He took a gun
with a&#8217; extra long carry and put a lead pill where
it&#8217;d do the most good; and the hull passel of us
was plumb tickled, that&#8217;s all, just plumb tickled&#8211;even t&#8217; the sheriff.</p>

<p>I said pill just now. Funny how I just fall
into the habit of usin&#8217; doctor words when I come
to talk of this par<i>tic</i>ular mix-up. That&#8217;s &#8217;cause
Simpson, the tin-horn gent I mentioned, is a
doc. And so&#8217;s Billy Trowbridge&#8211;Billy Trowbridge
is the best medicine-man we ever had in
these parts, if he <i>did</i> git all his learnin&#8217; right
here from his paw. He ain&#8217;t got the spondulix,
and so he ain&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call tony. But he&#8217;s
got his doctor certifi<i>cate,</i> O. K., and when it
comes t&#8217; curin&#8217;, he can give cards and spades to
<i>any</i> of you&#8217; highfalutin&#8217; college gezabas, and
<i>then</i> beat &#8217;em out by a mile. That&#8217;s <i>straight!</i></p>

<p>Billy, he&#8217;d allus liked Rose. And Rose&#8217;d allus
liked Billy. Wal, after Andrews&#8217;s s-a-d endin&#8217;,
you bet I made up my mind that Billy&#8217;d be ole
man Sewell&#8217;s next son-in-law. Billy was smart
as the dickens, and young, and no drunk. He
hadn&#8217;t never wore no hard hat, neither, &#8217;r roached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
his mane pompydory, and he was one of the kind
that takes a run at they fingernails oncet in a
while. Now, mebbe a puncher &#8217;r a red ain&#8217;t par-<i>tic</i>ular
about his hands; but a <i>pro</i>feshnal gent&#8217;s
<i>got</i> to be. And with a nice gal like Rose, it shore
do stack up.</p>

<p>But it didn&#8217;t stand the chanst of a snow-man
in Yuma when it come to ole man Sewell. Doc
Simpson was new in town, and Sewell&#8217;d ast him
out to supper at the Bar Y ranch-house two &#8217;r
three times. And he was clean stuck on him. To
hear the ole man talk, Simpson was the cutest
thing that&#8217;d ever come into the mesquite.
And Billy? Wal, he was the bad man from
Bodie.</p>

<p>Say! but all of us punchers was sore when
we seen how Sewell was haided!&#8211;not just the
ole man&#8217;s outfit at the Bar Y, y&#8217; savvy, but
the bunch of us at the Diamond O. None of
us liked Simpson a <i>little</i> bit. He wore fine
clothes, and a dicer, and when it come to soothin&#8217;
the ladies and holdin&#8217; paws, he was there with
both hoofs. Then, he had all kinds of fool jiggers
fer his business, and one of them toot surreys
that&#8217;s got ingine haidlights and two seats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
all stuffed with goose feathers and covered with
leather&#8211;reg&#8217;lar Standard Sleeper.</p>

<p>It was that gasoline rig that done Billy damage,
speakin&#8217; financial. The minute folks knowed
it was in Briggs City, why they got a misery
somewheres about &#8217;em quick&#8211;just to have it
come and stand out in front, smellin&#8217; as all-fired
nasty as a&#8217; Injun, but lookin&#8217; turrible stylish.
The men was bad enough about it, and
when they had one of Doc Simpson&#8217;s drenches
they haids was as big as Bill Williams&#8217;s Mountain.
But the women! The <i>hull</i> cavvieyard of
&#8217;em, exceptin&#8217; Rose, stampeded over to him. And
Billy got such a snow-under that they had him
a-diggin&#8217; fer his grass.</p>

<p>I was plumb crazy about it. &#8220;Billy,&#8221; I says
one day, when I met him a-comin&#8217; from &#8217;Pache
Sam&#8217;s hogan on his bi<i>cy</i>cle; &#8220;Billy, you got to
do somethin&#8217;.&#8221; (Course, I didn&#8217;t mention Rose.)
&#8220;You goin&#8217; to let any sawed-off, hammered-down
runt like that Simpson drive you out?
Why, it&#8217;s free grazin&#8217; here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy, he smiled kinda wistful and begun to
brush the alkali offen that ole Stetson of hisn,
turnin&#8217; it &#8217;round and &#8217;round like he was worried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
&#8220;Aw, never mind, Cupid,&#8221; he says; &#8220;&#8211;just keep
on you&#8217; shirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>But pretty soon things got a darned sight
worse, and I couldn&#8217;t hardly hole in. Not satisfied
with havin&#8217; the hull country on his trail account
of that surrey, Simpson tried a <i>new</i> deal: He
got to discoverin&#8217; bugs!</p>

<p>He found out that Bill Rawson had malaria
bugs, and the Kelly kid had diphtheria bugs, and
Dutchy had typhoid bugs that didn&#8217;t do business
owin&#8217; to the alcohol in his system. (<i>Too</i> bad!)
Why, it was astonishin&#8217; how many kinds of newfangled
critters we&#8217;d never heard of was a-livin&#8217;
in this Terrytory!</p>

<p>But all his bugs didn&#8217;t split no shakes with
<i>Rose</i>. She was <i>po</i>lite to Simpson, and friendly,
but nothin&#8217; worse. And it was plainer &#8217;n the nose
on you&#8217; face that Billy was solid with her. But
the ole man is the hull show in that fambly, y&#8217;
savvy; and all us fellers could do was to hope
like sixty that nothin&#8217; &#8217;d happen to give Simpson
a&#8217; extra chanst. But, crimini! Somethin&#8217; <i>did</i> happen:
Rose&#8217;s baby got sick. Wouldn&#8217;t eat, wouldn&#8217;t
sleep, kinda whined all the time, like a sick purp,
and begun to look peaked&#8211;pore little kid!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>I was out at the Bar Y that same day, and
when the news got over to the bunk-house, we
was all turrible <i>ex</i>cited. &#8220;Which&#8217;ll the ole man
send after,&#8221; we says, &#8220;&#8211;Simpson &#8217;r Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was that bug-doctor!</p>

<p>He come down the road two-forty, settin&#8217; up
as stiff as if he had a ramrod in his backbone. I
just happened over towards the house as he
turned in at the gate. He staked out his surrey
clost to the porch and stepped down. My! such
nice little button shoes!</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, maw!&#8221; says Monkey Mike; &#8220;he&#8217;s too
rich fer <i>my</i> blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>The ole man come out to say howdy. When
Simpson seen him, he says, &#8220;Mister Sewell,
they&#8217;s some hens &#8217;round here, and I don&#8217;t want
&#8217;em to hop into my machine whilst I&#8217;m in the
house.&#8221; Then, he looks at me. &#8220;Can you&#8217; hired
man keep &#8217;em shooed?&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Hired man! I took a jump his <i>di</i>rection that
come nigh to splittin&#8217; my boots. &#8220;Back up, m&#8217;
son,&#8221; I says, reachin&#8217; to my britches pocket. &#8220;<i>I</i>
ain&#8217;t no hired man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sewell, he puts in quick. &#8220;No, no, Doc,&#8221; he
says; &#8220;this man&#8217;s one of the Diamond O cow-boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
Fer heaven&#8217;s sake, Cupid! You&#8217;re gittin&#8217;
to be as touchy as a cook!&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson, he apologised, and I let her pass f er
<i>that</i> time. But, a-course, far&#8217;s him and <i>me</i> was
<i>con</i>cerned&#8211;wal, just wait. As I say, he goes in,&#8211;the ole man follerin&#8217;&#8211;leavin&#8217; that gasoline rig
snortin&#8217; and sullin&#8217; and lookin&#8217; as if it was just
achin&#8217; t&#8217; take a run at the bunk-house and bust
it wide open. I goes in, too,&#8211;just t&#8217; see the fun.</p>

<p>There was that Simpson examinin&#8217; the baby,
and Rose standin&#8217; by, lookin&#8217; awful scairt. He
had a rain-gauge in his hand, and was a-squintin&#8217;
at it important. &#8220;High temper&#8217;ture,&#8221; he says;
&#8220;&#8217;way up to hunderd and four.&#8221; Then he jabbed
a spoon jigger into her pore little mouth. Then
he made X brands acrosst her soft little back
with his fingers. Then he turned her plumb over
and begun to tunk her like she was a melon. And
when he&#8217;d knocked the wind outen her, he <i>pro</i>-duced
a bi<i>cy</i>cle pump, stuck it agin her chest,
and put his ear to the other end. &#8220;Lungs all
right,&#8221; he says; &#8220;heart all right. Must be<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;
Course, <i>you</i> know&#8211;bugs!</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;but, couldn&#8217;t it be teeth?&#8221; ast Rose.</p>

<p>Simpson grinned like she was a&#8217; idjit, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
was sorry as the dickens fer her. &#8220;Aw, a baby
ain&#8217;t <i>all</i> teeth,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Wal, he left some truck &#8217;r other. Then he
goes out, gits into his Pullman section, blows his
punkin whistle and <i>de</i>parts.</p>

<p>Next day, same thing. Temper&#8217;ture&#8217;s still up.
Medicine cain&#8217;t be kept down. Case turrible puzzlin&#8217;.
Makes all kinds of guesses. Leaves some
hoss liniment. Toot! toot!</p>

<p>Day after, changes the pro<i>gram</i>. Sticks a
needle into the kid and gits first blood. Says
somethin&#8217; about &#8220;Modern scientific idears,&#8221; and
tracks back t&#8217; town.</p>

<p>Things run along that-a-way fer a week.
Baby got sicker and sicker. Rose got whiter
and whiter, and thinned till she was about as
hefty as a shadda. Even the ole man begun t&#8217;
look kinda pale &#8217;round the gills. But Simpson
didn&#8217;t miss a trick. And he come t&#8217; the ranch-house
so darned many times that his buckboard
plumb oiled down the pike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rose,&#8221; I says oncet to her, when I stopped
by, &#8220;cain&#8217;t we give Billy Trowbridge a chanst?
That Simpson doc ain&#8217;t worth a hill of beans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. She just turned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
lent over the kid. Gee whiz! I hate t&#8217; see a
woman cry!</p>

<p>&#8217;Way early, next day, the kid had a <i>con</i>vul-sion,
and ev&#8217;rybody was shore she was goin&#8217; to
kick the bucket. And whilst a bunch of us was
a-hangin&#8217; &#8217;round the porch, pretty nigh luny
about the pore little son-of-a-gun, Bill Rawson
come&#8211;and he had a story that plumb took the
last kink outen us.</p>

<p>I hunts up the boss. &#8220;Mister Sewell,&#8221; I says,
by way of beginnin&#8217;, &#8220;I&#8217;m feard we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
lose the baby. Simpson ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; much, seems
like. What y&#8217; say if I ride in fer Doc Trowbridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trowbridge?&#8221; he says disgusted. &#8220;<i>No,</i>
ma&#8217;am! Simpson&#8217;ll be here in a jiffy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon Simpson&#8217;ll be late,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Bill
Rawson seen him goin&#8217; towards Goldstone just
now in his thrashin&#8217;-machine with a feemale
settin&#8217; byside him. Bill says she was wearin&#8217; one
of them fancy collar-box hats, with a duck-wing
hitched on to it, and her hair was all mussy over
her eyes&#8211;like a cow with a board on its horns&#8211;and she had enough powder on her face t&#8217;
make a biscuit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>The ole man begun t&#8217; chaw and spit like a
bob-cat. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t astin&#8217; Bill&#8217;s <i>ad</i>vice,&#8221; he says.
&#8220;When I want it, I&#8217;ll let him know. If Simpson&#8217;s
busy over t&#8217; Goldstone, we got to wait
on him, that&#8217;s all. But Trowbridge? Not <i>no</i>-ways!&#8221;</p>

<p>I seen then that it was time somebody mixed in.
I got onto my pinto bronc and loped fer town.
But all the way I couldn&#8217;t think what t&#8217; do. So
I left Maud standin&#8217; outside of Dutchy&#8217;s, and
went over and sit down next Hairoil on the
truck. And that&#8217;s where I was&#8211;a-hummin&#8217; to
myself and a-workin&#8217; my haid&#8211;when he give me
that rakin&#8217; over about playin&#8217; Cupid, and warned
me agin monkeyin&#8217; with ole man Sewell.</p>

<p>Wal, when Hairoil up and left me, I kept
right on a-studyin&#8217;. I knowed, a-course, that I
could go kick up a fuss when Simpson stopped
by his office on his trip back from Goldstone.
But that didn&#8217;t seem such a&#8217; awful good plan.
Also, I could<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>Just then, I heerd my cow-pony kinda whinny.
I glanced over towards her. She was standin&#8217;
right where I&#8217;d left her, lines on the ground,
eyes peeled my way. And <i>such</i> a look as she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
a-givin&#8217; me!&#8211;like she knowed what I was a-worryin&#8217;
about and was surprised I was so blamed
thick.</p>

<p>I jumped up and run over to her. &#8220;Maud,&#8221;
I says, &#8220;you got more savvy &#8217;n any horse I know,
bar <i>none</i>. <i>Danged if we don&#8217;t do it!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>First off, I sent word t&#8217; Billy that he was to
show up at the Sewell ranch-house about four
o&#8217;clock. And when three come, me and Maud
was on the Bar Y road where it goes acrosst that
crick-bottom. She was moseyin&#8217; along, savin&#8217;
herself, and I was settin&#8217; sideways like a real
lady so&#8217;s I could keep a&#8217; eye towards town.
Pretty soon, &#8217;way back down the road, &#8217;twixt the
barb-wire fences, I seen a cloud of dust a-travellin&#8217;&#8211;a-travellin&#8217;
so fast they couldn&#8217;t be no
mistake. And in about a minute, the signs was
complete&#8211;I heerd a toot. I put my laig over then.</p>

<p>Here he come, that Simpson in his smelly
Pullman, takin&#8217; the grade like greased lightin&#8217;.
&#8220;Now, Maud!&#8221; I whispers to the bronc. And,
puttin&#8217; my spurs into her, I begun t&#8217; whip-saw
from one fence to the other.</p>

<p>He slowed up and blowed his whistle.</p>

<p>I hoed her down harder&#8217;n ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a-skeerin&#8217; my hoss,&#8221; I yells back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull t&#8217; one side,&#8221; he answers. &#8220;I want to
git by.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Maud wouldn&#8217;t pull. And everywheres
Simpson was, she was just in front, actin&#8217; as if
she was scairt plumb outen her seven senses. The
worse she acted, a-course, the madder <i>I</i> got!
Fin&#8217;lly, just as Mister Doc was managin&#8217; to
pass, I got <i>turrible</i> mad, and, cussin&#8217; blue blazes,
I took out my forty-five and let her fly.</p>

<p>One of them hind tires popped like the evenin&#8217;
gun at Fort Wingate. Same minute, that hidebound
rig-a-ma-jig took a shy and come nigh
buttin&#8217; her fool nose agin a fence-post. But
Simpson, he geed her quick and started on. I
put a hole in the other hind tire. She shied again&#8211;opp&#8217;site <i>di</i>rection&#8211;snortin&#8217; like she was wind-broke.
He hawed her back. Then he went
a-kitin&#8217; on, leavin&#8217; me a-eatin&#8217; his dust.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#8217;t <i>done</i> with him, no, ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>Right there the road make a kinda horse-shoe
turn&#8211;like this, y&#8217; savvy&#8211;to git &#8217;round a fence
corner. I&#8217;d cal&#8217;lated on that. I just give Maud
a lick &#8217;longside the haid, jumped her over the
fence, quirted her a-flyin&#8217; acrosst that bend, took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
the other fence, and landed about a hunderd feet
in front of him.</p>

<p>When he seen me through his goggles, he
come on full-steam. I set Maud a-runnin&#8217; the
same <i>di</i>rection&#8211;and took up my little rope.</p>

<p>About two shakes of a lamb&#8217;s tail, and it happened.
He got nose and nose with me. I
throwed, ketchin&#8217; him low&#8211;&#8217;round his chest and
arms. Maud come short.</p>

<p>Say! talk about you&#8217; <i>flyin&#8217;</i>-machines! Simpson
let go his holt and took to the air, sailin&#8217; up
right easy fer a spell, flappin&#8217; his wings all the
time; then, doublin&#8217; back somethin&#8217; amazin&#8217;, and
fin&#8217;lly comin&#8217; down t&#8217; light.</p>

<p>And that gasoline bronc of hisn&#8211;minute she
got the bit, she acted plumb loco. She shassayed
sideways fer a rod, buckin&#8217; at ev&#8217;ry jump. Pretty
soon, they was a turn, but she didn&#8217;t see it. She
left the road and run agin the fence, cuttin&#8217; the
wires as clean in two as a pliers-man. Then,
outen pure cussedness, seems like, she made
towards a cottonwood, riz up on her hind laigs,
clumb it a ways, knocked her wind out, pitched
oncet &#8217;r twicet, tumbled over on to her quarters,
and begun t&#8217; kick up her heels.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i2'></a><img src='images/illus-020.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;<i>He lay the kid lookin&#8217; up and put his finger into her mouth</i>&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>I looked at Simpson. He&#8217;d been settin&#8217; on the
ground; but now he gits up, pullin&#8217; at the rope
gentle, like a lazy sucker. Say! but his face was
ornamented!</p>

<p>I give him a nod. &#8220;Wal, Young-Man-That-Flies-Like-A-Bird?&#8221;
I says, inquirin&#8217;.</p>

<p>He began to paw up the road like a mad bull.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you pay fer this!&#8221; he bellered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cain&#8217;t git blood outen a turnip,&#8221; I answers,
sweet as sugar; and Maud backed a step
&#8217;r two, so&#8217;s the rope wouldn&#8217;t slack.</p>

<p>&#8220;How <i>dast</i> you do such a&#8217; in<i>fame</i>ous thing!&#8221;
he goes on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gasoline gents got t&#8217; have a lesson,&#8221; I
answers; &#8220;you let the stuff go t&#8217; you&#8217; haids.
Why, a <i>hired man</i> ain&#8217;t got a chanst fer his life
when you happen t&#8217; be travellin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He begun t&#8217; wiggle his arms. &#8220;You lemme
go,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go where?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;T&#8217; my machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked over at her. She was quiet now, but
sweatin&#8217; oil somethin&#8217; awful. &#8220;How long&#8217;ll it
take you t&#8217; git her on to her laigs?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s ruined!&#8221; he says, like he was goin&#8217; to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
bawl. &#8220;And I meant t&#8217; go down to Goldstone
t&#8217;night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That duck-wing lady&#8217;ll have t&#8217; wait fer the
train,&#8221; I says. &#8220;But never mind. I&#8217;ll tell Rose
Andrews you got the <i>en</i>gagement.&#8221; Then Maud
slacked the rope and I rode up t&#8217; him, so&#8217;s to let
him loose. &#8220;So long,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t done with you!&#8221; he answers, gittin&#8217;
purple; &#8220;I ain&#8217;t done with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, you know where I live,&#8221; I says, and
loped off, hummin&#8217; the tune the ole cow died on.</p>

<p>When I rid up to the Bar Y ranch-house,
here was Billy, gittin&#8217; offen that little bi<i>cy</i>cle
of hisn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says, and he was whiter&#8217;n chalk-rock,
&#8220;is the baby worse? And Rose<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I pulled him up on to the porch. &#8220;Now&#8217;s
you&#8217; chanst, Billy,&#8221; I answers. &#8220;<i>Do you&#8217; darnedest!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose opened the door, and her face was as
white as hisn. &#8220;Aw, Billy!&#8221; was all she says.</p>

<p>Then up come that ole fool paw of hern,
totin&#8217; the kid. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he ast, mad as a
hornet. &#8220;And where&#8217;s Doc Simpson?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was me that spoke. &#8220;Doc Simpson&#8217;s had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
a turrible accident,&#8221; I answers. &#8220;His gasoline
plug got to misbehavin&#8217; down the road a piece,
and plumb tore her insides out. He got awful
shook up, and couldn&#8217;t come no further, so&#8211;knowin&#8217;
the baby was so sick&#8211;I went fer Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill!&#8221; says the ole man, disgusted. &#8220;<i>Thun-deration!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>But Billy had his tools out a&#8217;ready and was
a-reachin&#8217; fer the kid. Sewell let him have her&#8211;cussin&#8217;
like a mule-skinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he says to Rose; &#8220;that&#8217;s right,&#8211;let him massacree her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose didn&#8217;t take no notice. &#8220;Aw, Billy!&#8221; she
kept sayin&#8217;, and &#8220;Aw, baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy got to doin&#8217; things. He picked somethin&#8217;
shiny outen his kit and slipped it into a pocket.
Next, he lay the kid lookin&#8217; up and put his finger
into her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he says to me.</p>

<p>I peeked in where he pointed and seen a reg&#8217;lar
little hawg-back of gum, red on the two slopes,
but whitish in four spots along the ridge, like
they&#8217;d been a snowfall. Billy grinned, took out
that shiny instrument, and give each of them
pore little gum buttes the double cross&#8211;zip-<i>zip,</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
zip-<i>zip,</i> zip-<i>zip,</i> zip-<i>zip</i>. And, jumpin&#8217; buffaloes!
<i>out pops four of the prettiest teeth a man
ever seen!</i></p>

<p>Bugs?&#8211;rats!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, a little Bella Donnie,&#8221; says Bill, &#8220;and
the baby&#8217;ll be O. K.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O. K.!&#8221; says Rose. &#8220;Aw, Billy!&#8221; And <i>such</i>
a kissin&#8217;!&#8211;the baby, a-<i>course</i>.</p>

<p>Ole man Sewell stopped swearin&#8217; a minute.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Teeth,&#8221; says Billy.</p>

<p>Think of that! Why, the trouble was so clost
to Simpson that if it&#8217;d been a rattler, it&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; bit
him!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Teeth!</i>&#8221; says the ole man, like he didn&#8217;t believe
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come look,&#8221; says Billy.</p>

<p>Sewell, he walked over to the baby and stooped
down. Then all of a suddent, I seen his jaw go
open, and his eyes stick out so far you could &#8217;a&#8217;
knocked &#8217;em off with a stick. Then, he got red
as a turkey gobbler&#8211;and let out a reg&#8217;lar war-whoop.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Look</i> at &#8217;em!&#8221; he yelped. &#8220;Rose! Rose!&#8211;<i>look</i>
at &#8217;em! Four all to oncet!&#8221; And he give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
the doc such a wallop on the back that it come
nigh to knockin&#8217; him down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I says sarcastic, &#8220;but, shucks! a
baby ain&#8217;t <i>all</i> teeth. This is a mighty puzzlin&#8217;
case, and Simpson<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Close you&#8217; fly-trap,&#8221; says the ole man, &#8220;and
look at them teeth! Four of a kind&#8211;can y&#8217;
beat it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-a-al,&#8221; I says, sniffin&#8217;, &#8220;they&#8217;s so, so, I
reckon, but any kid<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Any</i> kid!&#8221; yells the ole man, plumb aggervated.
And he was just turnin&#8217; round to give
<i>me</i> one when&#8211;in limps Simpson!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Sewell,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I come to make a
complaint&#8221;&#8211;he shook his fist at me&#8211;&#8220;agin this
here ruffian. He<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; roars Sewell. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you trouble
to make no complaints in <i>this</i> house. Here you
been a-treatin&#8217; this baby fer bugs when it was
just teeth. Say! you ain&#8217;t got sense enough to
come in when it rains!&#8221;</p>

<p>That plumb rattled Simpson. He was gittin&#8217;
a <i>re</i>ception he didn&#8217;t reckon on. But he tried t&#8217;
keep up his game.</p>

<p>&#8220;This cow-boy here is <i>re</i>sponsible fer damages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
to my auto,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The dashboard&#8217;s smashed
into matches, the tumblin&#8217;-rods is broke, the
spark-condenser&#8217;s kaflummuxed, and the hull
blamed business is skew-gee. This man was actin&#8217;
in you&#8217; behalf, and if he don&#8217;t pay, I&#8217;ll sue <i>you.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sue?&#8221; says Sewell; &#8220;<i>sue?</i> You go guess
again! You send in you&#8217; bill, that&#8217;s what <i>you</i> do.
You ain&#8217;t earned nothin&#8217;&#8211;but, by jingo, it&#8217;s
worth money just to git shet of such a dog-goned
shyster as you. <i>Git.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that, out goes Mister Bugs.</p>

<p>Then, grandpaw, he turns round to the baby
again, plumb took up with them four new nippers.
&#8220;Cluck, cluck,&#8221; he says like a chicken, and
pokes the kid under the chin. Over one shoulder,
he says to Billy, &#8220;And, Trowbridge, you can
make out <i>you&#8217;</i> bill, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy didn&#8217;t answer nothin&#8217;. Just went over
to a table, pulled out a piece of paper and a
pencil, and begun t&#8217; write. Pretty soon, he got
up and come back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Mister Sewell,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>I was right byside the ole man, and&#8211;couldn&#8217;t
help it&#8211;I stretched to read what Billy&#8217;d writ.
And this was what it was:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;<i>Mister Zach Sewell, debtor to W. A. Trowbridge,
fer medical services&#8211;the hand of one
Rose Andrews in marriage.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>Sewell, he read the paper over and over,
turnin&#8217; all kinds of colours. And Silly and me
come blamed nigh chokin&#8217; from holdin&#8217; our
breaths. Rose was lookin&#8217; up at us, and at her
paw, too, turrible anxious. As fer that kid, it
was a-kickin&#8217; its laigs into the air and gurglin&#8217;
like a bottle.</p>

<p>Fin&#8217;lly, the ole man handed the paper back.
&#8220;Doc,&#8221; he says, &#8220;Rose is past twenty-one, and
not a&#8217; idjit. Also, the kid is hern. So, bein&#8217; this
bill reads the way it does, mebbe you&#8217;d better
hand it t&#8217; her. If she don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too steep a
figger<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy took the paper and give it over to Rose.
When she read it, her face got all blushy; and
happy, too, I could see <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Rose!</i>&#8221; says Billy, holdin&#8217; out his two arms
to her.</p>

<p>I took a squint through the winda at the
scenery&#8211;and heerd a sound like a cow pullin&#8217;
its foot outen the mud.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>&#8220;Rose,&#8221; goes on Billy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be as good as I
know how to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I turned round again, here was ole
man Sewell standin&#8217; in the middle of the floor,
lookin&#8217; back and forth from Rose and Billy to
the kid&#8211;like it&#8217;d just struck him that he was
goin&#8217; t&#8217; lose his gal and the baby and all them
teeth. And if ever a man showed that he was
helpless and jealous and plumb hurt, why, that
was him. Next, here he was a-gazin&#8217; at me with a
queer shine in his eyes&#8211;almost savage. And say!
it got me some nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems Mister Cupid Lloyd is a-runnin&#8217;
things &#8217;round this here ranch-house,&#8221; he begun
slow, like he was holdin&#8217; in his mad.</p>

<p>I&#8211;wal, I just kinda stood there, and swallered
oncet &#8217;r twicet, and tried t&#8217; grin. (Didn&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; t&#8217; say, y&#8217; savvy, that&#8217;d be likely
t&#8217; hit him just right.)</p>

<p>&#8220;So Cupid&#8217;s gone and done it again!&#8221; he
goes on. &#8220;How accommodatin&#8217;! Haw!&#8221; And
he give one of them short, sarcastic laughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, just let me tell you,&#8221; he <i>con</i>tinues,
steppin&#8217; closter, &#8220;that I, fer one, ain&#8217;t got <i>no</i>
use fer a feller that&#8217;s allus a-stickin&#8217; in his lip.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>&#8220;Sewell,&#8221; I says, &#8220;no feller <i>likes</i> to&#8211;that&#8217;s a
cinch. But oncet in a while it&#8217;s plumb needful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, is it? And I s&#8217;pose <i>this</i> is one of them
cases. Wal, Mister Cupid, all I can say is this:
The feller that sticks in his lip <i>allus gits into
trouble.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes, them words of hisn come back to
me. Mebbe I&#8217;ll be feelin&#8217; awful good-natured,
and be a-laughin&#8217; and talkin&#8217;. Of a suddent,
up them words&#8217;ll pop, and the way he said &#8217;em,
and all. And even if it&#8217;s right warm weather,
why, I <i>shiver,</i> yas, ma&#8217;am. <i>The fetter that
sticks in his lip allus gits into trouble</i>&#8211;nothin&#8217;
was ever said truer&#8217;n that!</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; the ole man goes on again, a little bit
hoarse by now, &#8220;I can feel you&#8217; trouble a-comin&#8217;.
So far, you been lucky. But it cain&#8217;t last&#8211;it
cain&#8217;t last. You know what it says in the Bible?
(Mebbe it ain&#8217;t in the Bible, but that don&#8217;t matter.)
It says, &#8216;Give a fool a rope and he&#8217;ll hang
hisself.&#8217; And one of these times you&#8217;ll play Cupid
just oncet too many. What&#8217;s more, the smarty
that can allus bring other folks t&#8217;gether cain&#8217;t
never manage t&#8217; hitch hisself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been keepin&#8217; still &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t want they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
should be no hard feelin&#8217;s &#8217;twixt us. But that
last <i>re</i>mark of hisn kinda got my dander up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I answers; &#8220;when it
comes my own time, I don&#8217;t figger t&#8217; have much
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, sir, the old man flew right up. His face
got the colour of sand-paper, and he brung his
two hands t&#8217;gether clinched, so&#8217;s I thought he&#8217;d
plumb crack the bones. &#8220;Haw!&#8221; (That
laugh again&#8211;bitter&#8217;n gall.) &#8220;Mister Cupid
Lloyd, <i>you just wait.</i>&#8221; And out he goes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; says Billy, &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>turrible</i> sorry.
Seems, somehow, that you&#8217;ve got Sewell down on
y&#8217; account of me<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Doc,&#8221; I answers; &#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t
keer. It mocks nix oudt, as Dutchy &#8217;d say.&#8221;
And I shook hands with him and Rose, and kissed
the baby.</p>

<p>It mocks nix oudt&#8211;that&#8217;s what I said. Wal,
how was I t&#8217; know then, that I&#8217;d made a&#8217; enemy
of the <i>one</i> man that, later on, I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; t&#8217; give
my <i>life</i> t&#8217; please, almost?&#8211;<i>how</i> was I t&#8217; know?</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Ain&#8217;t</span> it funny what little bits of things can
sorta change a feller&#8217;s life all &#8217;round ev&#8217;ry which
<i>di</i>rection&#8211;shuffle it up, you might say, and
throw him out a brand new deal? Now, take
my case: If a sassy greaser from the Lazy X
ranch hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; plugged Bud Hickok, Briggs
City &#8217;d never &#8217;a&#8217; got the parson; if the parson
hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; came, I&#8217;d never &#8217;a&#8217; gone to church;
and mebbe if I hadn&#8217;t never &#8217;a&#8217; gone to church,
it wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; made two cents diff&#8217;rence whether
ole man Sewell was down on me &#8217;r not&#8211;fer the
reason that, likely, I&#8217;d never &#8217;a&#8217; met up with Her.</p>

<p>Now, I ain&#8217;t a-sayin&#8217; I&#8217;m a&#8217; almanac, ner one
of them crazies that can study the trails in the
middle of you&#8217; hand and tell you that you&#8217;re
a-goin&#8217; to have ham and aigs fer breakfast.
No, ma&#8217;am, I ain&#8217;t neither one. But, just the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
same, the very first time I clapped my lookers on
the new parson, I knowed they was shore goin&#8217;
to be sev&#8217;ral things a-happenin&#8217; &#8217;fore long in
that par<i>tic</i>ular section of Oklahomaw.</p>

<p>As I said, Bud was <i>re</i>sponsible fer the parson
comin&#8217;. Bud tied down his holster just oncet
too many. The greaser called his bluff, and
pumped lead into his system some. That called
fer a funeral. Now, Mrs. Bud, she&#8217;s Kansas
City when it comes to bein&#8217; high-toned. And
nothin&#8217; would do but she must have a preacher.
So the railroad agent got Williams, Arizonaw,
on his click-machine, and we got the parson.</p>

<p>He was a new breed, that parson, a genuwine
no-two-alike, come-one-in-a-box kind. He was
big and young, with no hair on his face, and
brownish eyes that &#8217;peared to look plumb through
y&#8217; and out on the other side. Good-natured, y&#8217;
know, but actin&#8217; as if he meant ev&#8217;ry word he
said; foolin&#8217; a little with y&#8217;, too, and friendly as
the devil. And he didn&#8217;t wear parson duds&#8211;just
a grey suit; not like us, y&#8217; savvy&#8211;more
like what the hotel clerk down to Albuquerque
wears, &#8217;r one of them city fellers that comes
here to run a game.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>Wal, the way he talked over pore Bud was a
caution. Say! they was no &#8220;Yas, my brother,&#8221;
&#8217;r &#8220;No, my brother,&#8221; and no &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s will be
done&#8221; outen <i>him</i>&#8211;nothin&#8217; like it! And you&#8217;d
never &#8217;a&#8217; smelt gun-play. Mrs. Bud ner the
greaser that done the shootin&#8217;-up (he was at the
buryin&#8217;) didn&#8217;t hear no word <i>they</i> could kick at,
<i>no,</i> ma&#8217;am. The parson read somethin&#8217; about
the day you die bein&#8217; a darned sight better &#8217;n the
day you was born. And his hull razoo was so
plumb sensible that, &#8217;fore he got done, the passel
of us was all a-feelin&#8217;, somehow &#8217;r other, that
Bud Hickok had the drinks on us!</p>

<p>We planted Bud in city style. But the parson
didn&#8217;t shassay back to Williams afterwards.
We&#8217;d no more&#8217;n got our shaps on again, when
Hairoil blowed in from the post-office up the
street and let it out at the &#8220;Life Savin&#8217; Station,&#8221;
as Dutchy calls his thirst-parlour, that the parson
was goin&#8217; to squat in Briggs City fer a spell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, of all the dog-goned propositions!&#8221;
says Bill Rawson, mule-skinner over to the
Little Rattlesnake Mine. &#8220;What&#8217;s he goin&#8217; to
do that fer, Hairoil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heerd we was goin&#8217; to have a polo team,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
answers Hairoil. &#8220;Reckon he&#8217;s kinda loco on
polo. Anyhow, he&#8217;s took my shack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; I tole the crowd that was wettin&#8217; they
whistles, &#8220;this preachin&#8217; gent ain&#8217;t none of you&#8217;
ev&#8217;ry day, tenderfoot, hell-tooters. Polo, hey?
He&#8217;s got <i>savvy</i>. Look a leedle oudt, as Dutchy,
here, &#8217;d put it. Strikes me this feller&#8217;ll hang on
longer &#8217;n any other parson that was ever in these
parts ropin&#8217; souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole Dutch lay back his ears. &#8220;Better he
do&#8217;n make no trubbles mit me,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Say! that was like tellin&#8217; you&#8217; fortune. The
next day but one, right in front of the &#8220;Station,&#8221;
trouble popped. This is how:</p>

<p>The parson &#8217;d had all his truck sent over from
Williams. In the pile they was one of them big,
spotted dawgs&#8211;keerige dawgs, I think they call
&#8217;em. This par<i>tic</i>ular dawg was so spotted you
could &#8217;a&#8217; come blamed nigh playin&#8217; checkers on
him. Wal, Dutchy had a dawg, too. It wasn&#8217;t
much of anythin&#8217; fer fambly, I reckon,&#8211;just
plain purp&#8211;but it shore had a fine set of nippers,
and could jerk off the stearin&#8217; gear of a
cow quicker &#8217;n greazed lightnin&#8217;. Wal, the parson
come down to the post-office, drivin&#8217; a two-wheel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
thing-um-a-jig, all yalla and black.
&#8217;Twixt the wheels was trottin&#8217; his spotted
dawg. A-course, the parson &#8217;d no more&#8217;n
stopped, when out comes that ornery purp of
Dutchy&#8217;s. And such a set-to you never seen!</p>

<p>But it was all on one side, like a jug handle,
and the keerige dawg got the heavy end. He
yelped bloody murder and tried to skedaddle.
The other just hung on, and bit sev&#8217;ral of them
stylish spots clean offen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; says the parson to Dutchy, when he
seen the damage, &#8220;call off you&#8217; beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dutchy, he just grinned. &#8220;Ock,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;it mocks nix oudt if dey do sometinks. Here de
street iss not brivate broperty.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that, the parson clumb down and drug his
dawg loose. Then he looked up at the thirst-parlour.
&#8220;What a name fer a <i>saloon,</i>&#8221; he says,
&#8220;in a civilised country!&#8221;</p>

<p>A-course, us fellers enjoyed the fun, all right.
And we fixed it up t&#8217;gether to kinda sic the
Dutchman on. We seen that &#8220;Life Savin&#8217; Station&#8221;
stuck in the parson&#8217;s craw, and we made
out to Dutch that like as not he &#8217;d have to change
his sign.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>Dutch done a jig he was so mad. &#8220;Fer
<i>dat?</i>&#8221; he ast, meanin&#8217; the parson. &#8220;Nein!
He iss not cross mit my sign. He vut like it,
maype, if I gif him some viskey on tick. I bet
you he trinks, I bet. Maype he trinks ret ink
gocktails, like de Injuns; maype he trinks
Florita Vater, oder golone. Ya! Ya! Vunce
I seen a feller&#8211;I hat some snakes here in algohol&#8211;unt dat feller he trunk de algohol. <i>Ya</i>. Unt
de minister iss just so bat as dat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, to show how he liked <i>us</i>, Dutchy set up
the red-eye. And the <i>next</i> time the parson come
along in his cart, they was a dawg fight in front
of that saloon that was worth two-bits fer admission.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t think the rest of us was agin the parson,
though. We wasn&#8217;t. Fact it, we kinda liked
him from the jump. We liked his riggin&#8217;, we
liked the way he grabbed you&#8217; paw, and he was
no quitter when it come to a hoss. <i>Say!</i> but he
could ride! One day when he racked into the post-office,
his spur-chains a-rattlin&#8217; like a puncher&#8217;s,
and a quirt in his fist, one of the Bar Y
boys rounded him up agin the <i>meanest, low</i>-down
buckin&#8217; proposition that ever wore the hide of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
bronc. But the parson was game from his hay
to his hoofs. He clumb into the saddle and
stayed there, and went a-hikin&#8217; off acrosst the
prairie, independent as a pig on ice, just like he
was a-straddlin&#8217; some ole crow-bait!</p>

<p>So, when Sunday night come, and he preached
in the school-house, he had quite a bunch of
punchers corralled there to hear him. And I
was one of &#8217;em. (But, a-course, that first time,
I didn&#8217;t have no idear it was a-goin&#8217; to mean a
turrible lot to me, that goin&#8217; to church.) Wal,
I&#8217;m blamed if the parson wasn&#8217;t wearin&#8217; the
same outfit as he did week days. We liked that.
And he didn&#8217;t open up by tellin&#8217; us that we was
all branded and ear-marked a&#8217; ready by the Ole
Long-horn Gent. No, ma&#8217;am. He didn&#8217;t
<i>mention</i> everlastin&#8217; fire. And he didn&#8217;t ramp
and pitch and claw his hair. Fact is, he didn&#8217;t
hell-toot!</p>

<p>A-course, that spoiled the fun fer us. But he
talked so straight, and kinda easy and honest,
that he got us a-listenin&#8217; to what he <i>said</i>.</p>

<p>Cain&#8217;t say we was stuck on his text, though.
It run like this, that a smart man sees when a
row&#8217;s a-comin&#8217; and makes fer the tall cat-tails till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
the wind dies down. And he went on to say that a
man oughta be humble, and that if a feller gives
you a lick on the jaw, why, you oughta let him
give you another to grow on. Think o&#8217; that!
It may be O. K. fer preachers, and fer women
that ain&#8217;t strong enough t&#8217; lam back. But fer
me, <i>nixey</i>.</p>

<p>But that hand-out didn&#8217;t give the parson no
black eye with <i>us</i>. <i>We</i> knowed it was his duty
t&#8217; talk that-a-way. And two &#8217;r three of the boys
got t&#8217; proposin&#8217; him fer the polo team real serious&#8211;pervided,
a-course, that he&#8217;d stand fer a
little cussin&#8217; when the &#8217;casion <i>re</i>quired. It was
a cinch that he&#8217;d draw like wet rawhide.</p>

<p>Wal, the long and short of it is, he did. And
Sunday nights, the Dutchman lost money. He
begun t&#8217; josh the boys about gittin&#8217; churchy. It
didn&#8217;t do no good,&#8211;the boys didn&#8217;t give a whoop
fer his gass, and they liked the parson. All
Dutchy could do was to sic his purp on to
chawin&#8217; spots offen that keerige dawg.</p>

<p>But pretty soon he got plumb tired of just
dawg-fightin&#8217;. He <i>pre</i>pared to turn hisself
loose. And he advertised a free supper fer the
very next Sunday night. When Sunday night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
come, they say he had a reg&#8217;lar Harvey layout.
You buy a drink, and you git a stuffed pickle,
&#8217;r a patty de grass, &#8217;r a wedge of pie druv into
you&#8217; face.</p>

<p>No go. The boys was on to Dutchy. They
knowed he was the stingiest gezaba in these parts,
and wouldn&#8217;t give away a nickel if he didn&#8217;t
reckon on gittin&#8217; six-bits back. So, more fer devilment
&#8217;n anythin&#8217; else, the most of &#8217;em fooled him
some&#8211;just loped to the school-house.</p>

<p>The parson was plumb tickled.</p>

<p>But it didn&#8217;t last. The next Sunday, the
&#8220;Life Savin&#8217; Station&#8221; had Pete Gans up from
Apache to deal a little faro. And as it rained
hard enough t&#8217; keep the women folks away,
why, the parson preached to ole man Baker (he&#8217;s
deef), the globe and the chart and the map of
South Amuricaw. And almost ev&#8217;ry day of the
next week, seems like, that purp of Dutchy&#8217;s
everlastin&#8217;ly chawed the parson&#8217;s. The spotted
dawg couldn&#8217;t go past the thirst-parlour, &#8217;r anywheres
else. The parson took to fastenin&#8217; him
up. Then Dutchy&#8217;d mosey over towards Hairoil&#8217;s
shack. Out&#8217;d come Mister Spots. And
one, two, three, the saloon dawg &#8217;d sail into him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>Then a piece of news got &#8217;round that must &#8217;a&#8217;
made the parson madder &#8217;n a wet hen. Dutchy
cleaned the barrels outen his hind room and put
up a notice that the next Sunday night he&#8217;d
give a dance. To finish things, the dawgs had
a worse fight&#8217;n ever Friday mornin&#8217;, and the
parson&#8217;s lost two spots and a&#8217; ear.</p>

<p>I seen a change in the parson that evenin&#8217;.
When he come down to the post-office, them
brown eyes of his&#8217;n was plumb black, and his
face was redder&#8217;n Sam Barnes&#8217;s. &#8220;Things is
goin&#8217; to happen,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;&#8217;r <i>I</i> ain&#8217;t
no judge of beef.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sunday night, you know, a-course, where the
<i>boys</i> went. But I drawed lots with myself and
moseyed over to the school-house to keep a
bench warm. And here is when that new deal
was laid out on the table fer you&#8217; little friend
Cupid!</p>

<p>I slid in and sit down clost to the door.
Church wasn&#8217;t begun yet, and the dozen &#8217;r so of
women was a-waitin&#8217; quieter&#8217;n mice, some of
&#8217;em readin&#8217; a little, some of &#8217;em leanin&#8217; they haids
on the desks, and some of &#8217;em kinda peekin&#8217;
through they fingers t&#8217; git the lay of the land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
Wal, <i>I</i> stretched my neck,&#8211;and made out t&#8217;
count more&#8217;n fifty spit-balls on a life-size chalk
drawin&#8217; of the school-ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>Next thing, the parson was in and a-pumpin&#8217;
away&#8211;all fours&#8211;at the organ, and the bunch of
us was on our feet a-singin&#8217;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p class='i'>&#8220;Yield not to tempta-a-ation,</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Cause yieldin&#8217; is sin.</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each vic&#8217;try<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>We&#8217;d got about that far when I shut off, all
of a suddent, and cocked my haid t&#8217; listen.
Whose voice was that?&#8211;as clear, by thunder!
as the bugle up at the Reservation. Wal, sir, I
just stood there, mouth wide open.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p class='i'>&#8220;Some other to win.</p>
<p class='i'>Strive manfully onwards<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Then, I begun t&#8217; look &#8217;round. <i>Couldn&#8217;t</i> be
the Kelly kid&#8217;s maw (I&#8217;d heerd her call the
hawgs), ner the teacher, ner that tall lady next
her, ner<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>Spotted the right one! Up clost to the organ
was a gal I&#8217;d never saw afore. So many was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
the way that I wasn&#8217;t able t&#8217; git more&#8217;n a squint
at her back hair. But, say! it was <i>mighty</i>
pretty hair&#8211;brown, and all sorta curly over the
ears.</p>

<p>When the song was over, ole lady Baker sit
down just in front of me; and as she&#8217;s some
chunky, she cut off nearly the hull of my view.
&#8220;But, Cupid,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet that
wavy hair goes with a sweet face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minute after, the parson begun t&#8217; speak.
Wal, soon as ever he got his first words out, I seen
that the air was kinda blue and liftin&#8217;, like it is
&#8217;fore a thunder-shower. And his text? It was,
&#8220;Lo, I am full of fury, I am weary with holdin&#8217;
it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! <i>that&#8217;s</i> the kind of preachin&#8217; a <i>puncher</i>
likes!</p>

<p>After he was done, and we was all ready t&#8217;
go, I tried to get a better look at that gal. But
the women folks was movin&#8217; my <i>di</i>rection, shakin&#8217;
hands and gabblin&#8217; fast to make up fer lost time.
Half a dozen of &#8217;em got &#8217;round me. And when
I got shet of the bunch, she was just a-passin&#8217;
out at the far door. My! such a slim, little figger
and such a pert, little haid!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>I made fer the parson. &#8220;<i>Ex</i>cuse me,&#8221; I says
to him, &#8220;but wasn&#8217;t you talkin&#8217; to a young lady
just now? and if it ain&#8217;t too gally, can I <i>in</i>-quire
who she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yas,&#8221; answers the parson, smilin&#8217; and
puttin&#8217; one hand on my shoulder. (You know
that cuss never oncet ast me if I was a Christian?
Aw! I tell y&#8217;, he was a <i>gent</i>.) &#8220;That young
lady is Billy Trowbridge&#8217;s sister-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister-in-law!&#8221; I repeats. (She was married,
then. Gee! I hated t&#8217; hear that!
&#8217;Cause, just havin&#8217; helped Billy t&#8217; git his wife, y&#8217;
savvy, why<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>) &#8220;But, parson, I didn&#8217;t know
the Doc <i>had</i> a brother.&#8221; (I felt kinda down on
Billy all to oncet.)</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t,&#8221; says the parson. &#8220;(<i>Good</i>-night,
Mrs. Baker.) This young lady is Mrs. Trowbridge&#8217;s
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. <i>Trowbridge&#8217;s</i> sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8211;ole man Sewell&#8217;s youngest gal.
She&#8217;s been up to St. Louis goin&#8217; t&#8217; school.&#8221; He
turned out the bracket lamp.</p>

<p>Ole man Sewell&#8217;s youngest gal! Shore
enough, they <i>was</i> another gal in that fambly.
But she was just a kid when she was in Briggs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
the last time,&#8211;not more&#8217;n fourteen &#8217;r fifteen,
anyhow,&#8211;and I&#8217;d clean fergot about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name&#8217;s Macie,&#8221; goes on the parson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie&#8211;Macie Sewell&#8211;Macie.&#8221; I said it
over to myself two &#8217;r three times. I&#8217;d never
liked the name Sewell afore. But now, somehow,
along with <i>Her</i> name, it sounded awful
fine. &#8220;Macie&#8211;Macie Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid, I wisht you&#8217;d walk home with me,&#8221;
says the parson. &#8220;I want t&#8217; ast you about
somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tickled t&#8217; death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whilst he locked up, I waited outside. &#8220;M&#8217;
son,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;nothin&#8217; could be foolisher
than fer you to git you&#8217; eye fixed on a belongin&#8217;
of ole man Sewell&#8217;s. Just paste <i>that</i>
in you&#8217; sunbonnet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, I rid Shank&#8217;s mare over t&#8217; Hairoil&#8217;s.
Whilst we was goin&#8217;, the parson opened up on
the subject of Dutchy and that nasty, mean
purp of hisn. And I ketched on, pretty soon,
to just what he was a-drivin&#8217; at. I fell right in
with him. I&#8217;d never liked Dutchy such a turrible
lot anyhow,&#8211;and I did want t&#8217; be a friend
to the parson. So fer a hour after we hit the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
shack, you might &#8217;a&#8217; heerd me a-talkin&#8217; (if you&#8217;d
been outside) and him a-laughin&#8217; ev&#8217;ry minute
&#8217;r so like he&#8217;d split his sides.</p>

<p>Monday was quiet. I spent the day at Silverstein&#8217;s
Gen&#8217;ral Merchandise Store, which is
next the post-office. (Y&#8217; see, She might come
in fer the Bar Y mail.) The parson got off a
long letter to a feller at Williams. And Dutchy
was awful busy&#8211;fixin&#8217; up a fine shootin&#8217;-gallery
at the back of his &#8220;Life Savin&#8217; Station.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tuesday, somethin&#8217; happened at the parson&#8217;s.
Right off after the five-eight train come in
from the south, Hairoil druv down to the deepot
and got a big, square box and rushed home with
it. When he come into the thirst-parlour about
sun-set, the boys ast him what the parson was
gittin&#8217;. He just wunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet <i>I</i> knows,&#8221; says Dutchy. &#8220;De preacher
mans buys some viskey, alretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil snickered. &#8220;Wal,&#8221; he says, &#8220;what
I carried over was nailed up good and tight, all
right, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, say! that made the boys suspicious, and
made &#8217;em wonder if they wasn&#8217;t a darned good
<i>reason</i> fer the parson not wearin&#8217; duds like other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
religious gents, and fer his knowin&#8217; how to ride
so good. And they was <i>sore</i>&#8211;bein&#8217; that they&#8217;d
stood up so strong fer him, y&#8217; savvy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cow-punch,&#8221; says Monkey Mike, &#8220;&#8217;ll
swaller almost <i>any</i> ole thing, long &#8217;s it&#8217;s right out
on the table. But he shore cain&#8217;t go a <i>hippy-crit.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You blamed idjits!&#8221; chips in Buckshot Millikin,
him that owns such a turrible big bunch of
white-faces, and was run outen Arizonaw fer
rustlin&#8217; sheep, &#8220;what can y&#8217; expect of a preacher,
that comes from <i>Williams?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Dutchy seen how they all felt, and he was
plumb happy. &#8220;Vot I tole y&#8217;?&#8221; he ast. But
pretty soon he begun to laugh on the other side
of his face. &#8220;If dat preacher goes to run a bar
agin me,&#8221; he says, &#8220;py golly, I makes no more
moneys!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fer a minute, he looked plumb scairt.</p>

<p>But the boys was plumb <i>disgusted</i>. &#8220;The
parson&#8217;s been playin&#8217; us fer suckers,&#8221; they says
to each other; &#8220;he&#8217;s been a-soft-soapin&#8217; us,
a-flimflammin&#8217; us. He thinks we&#8217;s as blind as
day-ole kittens.&#8221; And the way that Tom-fool
of a Hairoil hung &#8217;round, lookin&#8217; wise, got under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
they collar. After they&#8217;d booted him outen
the shebang, they all sit down on the edge of the
stoop, just sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217;&#8211;but sawin&#8217; wood.</p>

<p>I sit down, too.</p>

<p>We wasn&#8217;t there more&#8217;n ten minutes when
one of the fellers jumped up. &#8220;There comes
the parson now,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Shore enough. There come the parson in his
fancy two-wheel Studebaker, lookin&#8217; as perky as
thunder. &#8220;Gall?&#8221; says Buckshot. &#8220;Wal, I
should smile!&#8221; Under his cart, runnin&#8217; &#8217;twixt
them yalla wheels, was his spotted dawg.</p>

<p>I hollered in to Dutchy. &#8220;Where&#8217;s you&#8217;
purp, Dutch?&#8221; I ast. &#8220;The parson&#8217;s haided this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dutchy was as tickled as a kid with a lookin&#8217;-glass
and a hammer. He dropped his bar-towel
and hawled out his purp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vatch me!&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>The parson was a good bit closter by now,
settin&#8217; up straight as a telegraph pole, and a-hummin&#8217;
to hisself. He was wearin&#8217; one of them
caps with a cow-catcher &#8217;hind and &#8217;fore, knee
britches, boots and a sweater.</p>

<p>&#8220;A svetter, mind y&#8217;!&#8221; says Dutchy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;Be a Mother Hubbard <i>next,</i>&#8221; says Bill
Rawson.</p>

<p>Somehow, though, as the parson come &#8217;longside
the post-office, most anybody wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
liked the way thinks looked. You could sorta
smell somethin&#8217; explodey. He was too all-fired
songful to be natu&#8217;al. And his dawg! That
speckled critter was as diff&#8217;rent from usual as
the parson. His good ear was curled up way in,
and he was kinda layin&#8217; clost to the ground as
he trotted along&#8211;layin&#8217; so clost he was plumb
<i>bow-legged</i>.</p>

<p>Wal, the parson pulled up. And he&#8217;d no
more&#8217;n got offen his seat when, first rattle outen
the box, them dawgs mixed.</p>

<p>Gee whillikens! <i>such</i> a mix! They wasn&#8217;t
much of the reg&#8217;lar ki-yin&#8217;. Dutchy&#8217;s purp
yelped some; but the parson&#8217;s? Not fer <i>him!</i>
He just got a good holt&#8211;a shore enough diamond
hitch&#8211;on that thirst-parlour dawg, and
chawed. <i>Say!</i> And whilst he chawed, the dust
riz up like they was one of them big sand-twisters
goin&#8217; through Briggs City. All of a
suddent, <i>how that spotted dawg could fight!</i></p>

<p>Dutchy didn&#8217;t know what &#8217;d struck him. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
runs out. &#8220;Come, hellup,&#8221; he yells to the parson.</p>

<p>The parson shook his head. &#8220;This street is
not my private property,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Then Dutchy jumped in and begun t&#8217; kick the
parson&#8217;s dawg in the snoot. The parson walks
up and stops Dutchy.</p>

<p>That made the Dutchman turrible mad. He
didn&#8217;t have no gun on him, so out he jerks his
pig-sticker.</p>

<p>What happened next made our eyes plumb
stick out. That parson side-stepped, put out a
hand and a foot, and with that highfalutin&#8217;
Jewie Jitsie you read about, tumbled corn-beef-and-cabbage
on to his back. Then he straddled
him and slapped his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieber!&#8221; screeched Dutchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; t&#8217; have any more Sunday night
dances?&#8221; ast the parson. (<i>Bing, bang</i>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Nein! Nein!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more&#8221; (<i>bing, bang</i>) &#8220;free Sunday
suppers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nein! Nein! Hellup!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to change this&#8221; (<i>biff, biff</i>) &#8220;saloon&#8217;s
name!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;Ya! Ya! <i>Gott!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The parson got up. &#8220;<i>Amen!</i>&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Then he runs into Silverstein&#8217;s, grabs a pail
of water, comes out again, and throws it on to
the dawgs.</p>

<p>The Dutchman&#8217;s purp was done fer a&#8217;ready.
And the other one was tired enough to quit. So
when the water splashed, Dutchy got his dawg
by the tail and drug him into the thirst-parlour.</p>

<p>But that critter of the parson&#8217;s. Soon as the
water touched him, them spots of hisn <i>begun to
run</i>. Y&#8217; see, he wasn&#8217;t the stylish keerige dawg
at all! <i>He was a jimber-jawed bull!</i></p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Wal, the next Sunday night, the school-house
was chuck full. She wasn&#8217;t there&#8211;no, Monkey
Mike tole me she was visitin&#8217; down to Goldstone;
but, a-course, all the <i>rest</i> of the women
folks was. And about forty-&#8217;leven cow-punchers
was on hand, and Buckshot, and Rawson
and Dutchy,&#8211;yas, ma&#8217;am, <i>Dutchy,</i> we rounded
<i>him</i> up. Do y&#8217; think after such a come-off we
was goin&#8217; to let that limburger run any compytition
place agin our parson?</p>

<p>And that night the parson stands up on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
platform, his face as shiny as a milk-pan, and all
smiles, and he looked over that cattle-town
bunch and says, &#8220;I take fer my text this evenin&#8217;,
&#8216;And the calf, and the young lion and the fatlin&#8217;
shall lie down in peace t&#8217;gether.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER THREE<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PRETTIEST GAL AND THE HOMELIEST MAN</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>I&#8217;m</span> just square enough to own <i>up</i> it was one
on me. But far&#8217;s that par<i>tic</i>ular mix-up goes, I
can <i>afford</i> to be honest, and let anybody snicker
that wants to&#8211;seein&#8217; the way the hull thing
turned out. &#8217;Cause how about Doc Simpson?
Didn&#8217;t I git bulge Number Two on him? And
how about the little gal? Didn&#8217;t it give me my
first chanst? <i>Course,</i> it did! And now, sometimes,
when I want to feel happier&#8217;n a frog in a
puddle, just a-thinkin&#8217; it all over, I lean back,
shut my two eyes, and say, &#8220;Ladies and gents,
this is where you git the Blackfoot Injun
Root-ee, the Pain Balm, the Cough Balsam, the
Magic Salve and the Worm Destroyer&#8211;the fi-i-ive
remedies fer two dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>That medicine show follered the dawg fight.
It hit Briggs City towards sundown one day, in
a prairie-schooner drawed by two big, white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
mules, and druv up to the eatin&#8217;-house. Out got
a smooth-faced, middle-aged feller in a linen
duster and half a&#8217; acre of hat&#8211;kinda part judge,
part scout, y&#8217; savvy; out got two youngish fellers
in fancy vests and grey dicers; next, a&#8217; Injun
in a blanket, and a lady in a yalla-striped shirtwaist.
Wal, sir, it was just like they&#8217;d struck
that town to start things a-movin&#8217; fer me!</p>

<p>The show hired the hall over Silverstein&#8217;s store.
Then one of them fancy vests walked up and
down Front Street, givin&#8217; out hand-bills. The
other sent word to all the ranches clost by, and
the Injun went &#8217;round to them scattered houses
over where the parson and Doc Trowbridge lives.</p>

<p>Them hand-bills read somethin&#8217; like this: The
<i>Re</i>nowned Blackfoot Medicine Company Gives
Its First Performance T&#8217;Night! Grand Open-Air
Band Concert. Come One, Come All. Free!
Free! Free! 3&#8211;The Marvellous Murrays&#8211;3.
To-Ko, the Human Snake, The World Has
Not His Equal. Miss Vera de Mille In Bewitchin&#8217;
Song and Dance. Amuricaw&#8217;s Greatest
Nigger Impersynater. The Fav&#8217;rite Banjoist
of the Sunny South. Injun Shadda Pictures,&#8211;and
a hull lot more I cain&#8217;t just <i>re</i>call.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>When I seen that such a big bunch was a-goin&#8217;
to preform, I walked over and peeked into that
schooner. I figgered, y&#8217; savvy, that they was
some more people in it that hadn&#8217;t come out yet.
But they wasn&#8217;t&#8211;only boxes and boxes of bottles.</p>

<p>Right after supper, that medicine outfit played
in front of Silverstein&#8217;s. The judge-lookin&#8217; feller
beat the drum, the Injun blowed a big brass dinguss,
the gal a clari&#8217;net, and the other two fellers
some shiny instruments curlier&#8217;n a pig&#8217;s tail.
But it was bully, that&#8217;s all <i>I</i> got to say, and
drawed like a mustard plaster. &#8217;Cause whilst in
Oklahomaw a <i>Injun</i> show don&#8217;t count fer much,
bein&#8217; that we got more&#8217;n our fill of reds, all the
same, with music throwed in, Briggs City was
there. And Silverstein&#8217;s hall was just jampacked.</p>

<p>The front seats was took up by the town kids,
a-course. Then come the women and gals,&#8211;a
sprinklin&#8217; of men amongst &#8217;em; behind <i>them,</i> the
cow-punchers. And in the back end of the place
a dozen &#8217;r so of niggers and cholos. Whilst all
was a-waitin&#8217; fer the show to begin, the punchers
done a lot of laughin&#8217; and cat-callin&#8217; to each other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
and made some consider&#8217;ble noise. I was along
with the rest, only up in one of the side windas,
settin&#8217; on the sill and swingin&#8217; my hoofs.</p>

<p>When the show opened, they was first a fine
piece&#8211;a march, I reckon&#8211;by the band. All the
time, more people was a-comin&#8217; in. &#8217;Mongst &#8217;em
was Doc Trowbridge and Rose, and Up-State&#8211;he
was that pore lunger that was here from the
East, y&#8217; savvy. Next, right after them three, that
Doc Simpson I was so all-fired stuck on. And,
along with him, a gal.</p>

<p>Wal, who do you think it was! <i>I</i> knowed to
oncet. They wasn&#8217;t no mistakin&#8217; that slim, little
figger and that pert little haid. It was <i>Her!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; whispered Hairoil Johnson (he was
settin&#8217; byside me), &#8220;it looks to me like you didn&#8217;t
much discourage that Noo York doc who owns
what&#8217;s left of a toot buggy. Failin&#8217; to git the
oldest gal out at the Bar Y, why, now he&#8217;s a-sailin&#8217;
&#8217;round with the youngest one.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. I was a-watchin&#8217; where
<i>she</i> was. I wanted t&#8217; ketch sight of her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I devilled ole man Sewell about kickin&#8217; him
out and then takin&#8217; him back,&#8221; goes on Hairoil.
&#8220;And Sewell said he was a punk doctor, but awful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
good comp&#8217;ny. Huh! Comp&#8217;ny ain&#8217;t what
<i>that</i> dude&#8217;s after. He&#8217;s after a big ranch and a
graded herd. It&#8217;s a blamed pity you didn&#8217;t git
<i>him</i> sent up t&#8217; Kansas City fer <i>re</i>pairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The band was a-playin&#8217;, but I didn&#8217;t pay much
attention to it. I kept a-watchin&#8217; that slim, little
figger a-settin&#8217; next Simpson&#8211;a-watchin&#8217; till I
plumb fergot where I was, almost. &#8220;Macie,&#8211;Macie
Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, I&#8217;m another if she didn&#8217;t look round!
And square at <i>me!</i> She wasn&#8217;t smilin&#8217;, just sober,
and sorta inquirin&#8217;. Her eyes looked dark, and
big. She had a square little chin, like the gals you
see drawed in pictures, and some soft, white, lacey
stuff was a-restin&#8217; agin her neck. They was two
&#8217;r three good-lookin&#8217; gals at the eatin&#8217;-house
them days, and Carlota Arnaz was awful pretty,
too. But none of &#8217;em couldn&#8217;t hole a candle t&#8217;
<i>this</i> one. Took in her cute little face whilst she
looked straight back at me. Say! them eyes of
hern come nigh pullin&#8217; me plumb outen that
winda!</p>

<p>Then the Judge walked out onto the platform,
and she faced for&#8217;ards again. &#8220;Ladies and
gents,&#8221; says the ole feller, talkin&#8217; like his mouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
was full of mush, &#8220;we have come to give you&#8217;
enterprisin&#8217; little city a free show. A free show,
ladies and gents,&#8211;it ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to cost you a
<i>nickel</i> to come here and enjoy you&#8217;self ev&#8217;ry
night. More&#8217;n that, we plan to stay as long as
you want us to. And we plan to give you the very
best talent in this hull United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time, the fancy-vest fellers was layin&#8217; a
carpet and fixin&#8217; a box and a table on the stage.
The Judge, he turned and waved his hand. &#8220;Our
first number,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will be the Murrays in
they marvellous act.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, them fancy-vests and the lady was the
Marvellous Murrays. And they was all in pink
circus-clothes. &#8220;Two brothers and a sister, I
guess,&#8221; says Hairoil. I should <i>hope</i> so! &#8217;Cause
the way they jerked each other &#8217;round was enough
t&#8217; bring on a fight if they hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been relations.
All three of &#8217;em could walk on they hands nigh
as good as on they feet, and turn somersets quicker&#8217;n
lightnin&#8217;. And when the somersettin&#8217; and
leap-froggin&#8217; come to oncet, it was grand! First
the big feller&#8217;d git down; then, the other&#8217;d step
onto his back. And as the big one bucked, his
brother&#8217;d fly up,&#8211;all in a ball, kinda&#8211;spin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
&#8217;round two &#8217;r three times, and light right side up.
And then they stood on each other&#8217;s faces like
they&#8217;d plumb flat &#8217;em out!</p>

<p>When they was done, they all come to the edge
of the platform, the lady kissin&#8217; her hand. All the
punchers kissed back!</p>

<p>Wal, ev&#8217;rybody laughed then, and clapped,
and the Judge brought on the Injun. That Injun
was smart, all right. Wiggled his fingers behind
a sheet and made &#8217;em look like animals, and like
people that was walkin&#8217; and bowin&#8217; and doin&#8217;
jigs. I wondered if Macie Sewell liked it. Guess
she did! She was a-smilin&#8217; and leanin&#8217; for&#8217;ards to
whisper to Billy and Rose. But not much to
Simpson, <i>I</i> thought. Say! I was glad of that.
Wasn&#8217;t <i>none</i> of my business, a-course. <i>Course,</i>
it wasn&#8217;t. But, just the same, whenever I seen
him put his haid clost to hern, it shore got under
my skin.</p>

<p>The Judge was out again. &#8220;Miss Vera de
Mille,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will sing &#8216;Wait Till the Sun
Shines, Maggie.&#8217;&#8221; Wal, if I hadn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; had reasons
fer stayin&#8217;, I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; waited a <i>minute</i>&#8211;reg&#8217;lar
cow-bellerin&#8217; in place of a voice, y&#8217; savvy.
What&#8217;s more, she was only that Marvellous Murray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
woman in diff&#8217;rent clothes! (No wonder they
wasn&#8217;t no more people in that outfit!) But I
didn&#8217;t keer about the show. I just never took my
eyes offen<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>She looked my way again!</p>

<p>Say! I was roped&#8211;right &#8217;round my shoulders,
like I&#8217;d roped Simpson! And I was plumb helpless.
That look of hern was a lasso, pullin&#8217; me to
her, steady and shore. &#8220;Macie&#8211;Macie Sewell,&#8221;
I whispered to myself, and I reckon my lips
moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You blamed idjit!&#8221; says Hairoil, out loud almost,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with you? You&#8217;ll have
me outen this winda in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge was bowin&#8217; some more. &#8220;We have
now come to the middle of our pro<i>gram,</i>&#8221; he says.
&#8220;But &#8217;fore I begin announcin&#8217; the last half, which
is our best, I want to tell you all a story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gents, I come t&#8217; Briggs to bring
you a message&#8211;a message which I feel bound to
deliver. And I&#8217;ve gone through a turrible lot to
be able to stand here to-night and say to you what
I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen! Years ago, a little boy, about so
high, with his father and mother and &#8217;leven sisters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
and brothers, started to cross the Plains with
a&#8217; ox-team. They reached the Blackfoot country
safe. But there, ladies and gents, a turrible thing
happened to &#8217;em. One day, more&#8217;n four hunderd
Injuns surrounded they wagon and showed fight.
They fit &#8217;em back, ladies and gents,&#8211;the father
and the mother and the children, killin&#8217; a good
many bucks and woundin&#8217; more. But the Injuns
was too many fer that pore fambly. And in a&#8217;
hour, the reds had captured one little boy&#8211;whilst
the father and mother and the &#8217;leven sisters and
brothers was no more!&#8221; (The Judge, he sniffled
a little bit.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The little boy was carried to a big Injun
camp,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;And it was here, ladies and
gents,&#8211;it was here he seen <i>won</i>-derful things.
He seen them Injuns that was wounded put some
salve on they wounds and be healed; he seen others,
that was plumb tuckered with fightin&#8217;, drink
a blackish medicine and git up like new men.
Natu&#8217;lly, he wondered what was <i>in</i> that salve,
and what was <i>in</i> that medicine. Wal, he made
friends with a nice Injun boy. He ast him <i>questions</i>
about that salve and that medicine. He
learnt what plants was dug to make both of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
&#8217;em. Then, one dark night, he crawled outen his
wigwam on his hands and knees. Behind him
come his little Injun friend. They went slow and
soft to where was the pony herd. They caught
up two fast ponies, and clumb onto &#8217;em, dug in
they spurs, and started eastwards as fast as they
could go. The white boy&#8217;s heart was filled with
joy, ladies and gents. He had a secret in his
bosom that meant health to ev&#8217;ry <i>man, woman</i> and
<i>child</i> of his own race. As he galloped along, he
says to hisself, &#8216;I'll spend my <i>life</i> givin&#8217; this
priceless secret to the world!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ladies and gents, that&#8217;s what he begun
to do&#8211;straight off. And t&#8217;-night, my dear
friends, that boy is in Briggs City!&#8221; (A-course,
ev&#8217;rybody begun to look &#8217;round fer him.) &#8220;Prob-&#8217;bly,&#8221;
goes on the Judge, &#8220;they&#8217;s more&#8217;n a hunderd
people in this town that&#8217;ll thank Providence
he come: They&#8217;s little children that won&#8217;t be orphans;
they&#8217;s wives that won&#8217;t be widdas. Fer he
is anxious to tell &#8217;em of a remedy that will cure
a-a-all the ills of the body. And, ladies and gents,
<i>I</i>&#8211;am&#8211;that&#8211;boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>That got the punchers so excited and so tickled,
that they hollered and stamped and banged and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
done about twenty dollars&#8217; worth of damage to
the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; goes on the Judge, &#8220;I have
<i>pre</i>pared, aided by my dear Injun comrade here,
the sev&#8217;ral kinds of medicines discovered by the
Blackfeet.&#8221; The fancy-vests, rigged out like
Irishmen, was fixin&#8217; a table and puttin&#8217; bottles on
to it. &#8220;I have these wonderful medicines with me,
and I sell &#8217;em at a figger that leaves only profit
enough fer the five of us to live on. I do <i>more&#8217;n</i>
that. Ev&#8217;rywheres I go, I <i>pre</i>sent, as a soovneer
of my visit, <i>a handsome, solid-gold watch and
chain.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Out come that singin&#8217; lady, hoidin&#8217; the watch
and chain in front of her so&#8217;s the crowd could see.
My! what a lot of whisperin&#8217;!</p>

<p>&#8220;This elegant gift,&#8221; <i>con</i>tinues the Judge, &#8220;is
<i>a</i>warded by means of a votin&#8217; contest. And it goes
to the prettiest gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>More whisperin&#8217;, and I sees a brakeman git up
and go over to talk to another railroad feller.
Wal, <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t have to be tole who was the prettiest
gal!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies and gents,&#8221;&#8211;the Judge again&#8211;&#8220;in
this contest, <i>ev&#8217;ry</i>body is allowed to vote. All a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
person has to do is to take two dollars&#8217; worth of
my medicine. Each two-dollar buy gives you ten
votes fer the prettiest gal; and just to add a little
fun to the contest, it also gives you ten votes fer
the homeliest man. If you buy these medicines,
you&#8217;ll never want to buy no others. Here&#8217;s where
you git the Blackfoot Injun Rootee, my friends,
the Pain Balm, the Cough Balsam, the Magic
Salve, and the Worm Destroyer&#8211;the fi-i-ive remedies
fer two dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he drawed a good, long breath and begun
again, tellin&#8217; us just what the diff&#8217;rent medicines
was good fer. When he was done, he says,&#8211;playin&#8217;
patty-cake with them fat hands of hisn&#8211;&#8220;Now,
who&#8217;ll be the first to buy, and name a
choice fer the prettiest gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Up jumps that brakeman, &#8220;Gimme two dollars&#8217;
worth of you&#8217; dope,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and drop ten
votes in the box fer Miss Mollie Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Eatin&#8217;-house waitress, y&#8217; savvy.)</p>

<p>&#8220;And the ugliest man?&#8221; ast the Judge, whilst
one of the fancy vests took in the cash and handed
over the medicine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monkey Mike,&#8221; answers the brakeman. And
then the boys began t&#8217; josh Mike.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m a sucker, too,&#8221; hollers the other railroad
feller. &#8220;Here&#8217;s ten <i>more</i> votes fer Miss
Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, in she come,&#8211;pompydore stickin&#8217;
up like a hay-stack. The railroad bunch, they give
a cheer. Huh!</p>

<p>I got outen that winda and onto my feet.
&#8220;Judge,&#8221; I calls, puttin&#8217; up one hand to show him
who was a-talkin&#8217;, &#8220;here&#8217;s <i>eight</i> dollars fer you&#8217;
rat-pizen. And you can chalk down forty votes
fer Miss Macie Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! cain&#8217;t you hear them Bar Y punchers?&#8211;&#8220;<i>Yip!
yip! yip! yip! yip! yip! ye-e-e!</i>&#8221; A-course
all the <i>other</i> punchers, they hollered, too. And
whilst we was yellin&#8217;, that tenderfoot from Noo
York was a-jabberin&#8217; to Macie, mad like, and
scowlin&#8217; over my way. And she? Wal, she was
laughin&#8217;, and blushin&#8217;, and shakin&#8217; that pretty
haid of hern&#8211;at <i>me!</i></p>

<p>I was so <i>ex</i>cited I didn&#8217;t know whether I was
a-foot &#8217;r a-hoss-back. But I knowed enough to
<i>buy,</i> all right. Wal, that medicine went like hotcakes!
I blowed <i>my</i>self, and Hairoil blowed <i>his</i>-self,
and the Bar Y boys cleaned they pockets till
the bottles was piled up knee-high byside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
benches. And whilst we shelled out, the Judge
kept on a-goin&#8217; like he&#8217;d been wound up&#8211;&#8220;Here&#8217;s
<i>another</i> feller that wants Root-ee! and
here&#8217;s another over on this side! And, lady, it&#8217;ll
be good fer you, too, <i>yas,</i> ma&#8217;am. The Blackfoot
Injun Rootee, my friends, the Pain Balm, the
Cough Balsam, the Magic Salve, and the Worm
Destroyer,&#8211;the fi-i-ive remedies fer two dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>When I come to, a little bit later on, the hall
was just about empty, and Hairoil was pullin&#8217; me
by the arm to git me to move. I looked &#8217;round fer
Macie Sewell. She was gone, and so was the
Doc and Billy Trowbridge and Rose and Up-State.
Outside, right under my window, I
ketched sight of a white dress a-goin&#8217; past. It
was her. &#8220;Macie,&#8221; I whispers to myself; &#8220;Macie
Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night, I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I was upset
kinda, and just crazy with thinkin&#8217; how I&#8217;d help
her to win out. And I made up my mind t&#8217; this:
If more votes come in fer Mollie Brown than they
did fer the gal that <i>oughta</i> have &#8217;em, why, I&#8217;d
just shove a gun under that Judge&#8217;s nose and tell
him to &#8220;count &#8217;em over and <i>count &#8217;em right.</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
&#8217;Cause, I figgered, no eatin&#8217;-house gal with a face
like a flat-car was a-goin&#8217; to be <i>e</i>lected the prettiest
gal of Briggs. Not if <i>I</i> seen myself, <i>no,</i>
ma&#8217;am. &#8217;Specially not whilst Sewell&#8217;s little gal
was in the country. Anybody could pick <i>her</i> fer
the winner if they had on blinders. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; I
says, &#8220;you hump you&#8217;self!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day, the Judge, he give consultin&#8217;s in the
eatin&#8217;-house sample-room. I went over and had
a talk with him, tellin&#8217; him just how I wanted that
votin&#8217; contest to go. He said he wisht me luck,
but that if the railroad boys felt they needed his
medicine, he didn&#8217;t believe he had no right to keep
&#8217;em from buyin&#8217;. And, a-course, when a feller
made a buy, he wanted t&#8217; vote like he pleased.
Said the best thing was t&#8217; git holt of folks that &#8217;d
met Miss Sewell and liked her, &#8217;r wanted t&#8217; work
fer her ole man, &#8217;r &#8217;d just as lief do <i>me</i> a good
turn.</p>

<p>I hunted up Billy. &#8220;Doc,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I <i>hope</i>
Briggs ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to name that Brown waitress
fer its best sample. Now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, wal,&#8221; says Billy, &#8220;think how it &#8217;d tickle
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tickle some other gal just as much,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>&#8220;And the <i>prettiest</i> gal ought to be choosed.
Now, it could be fixed&#8211;<i>easy.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you think it oughta be?&#8221; ast Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strikes me you&#8217; wife&#8217;s little sister is the pick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; says Billy, lookin&#8217; anxious like,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you git you&#8217;self too much inter<i>est</i>ed in
Macie Sewell. You know how the ole man feels
towards you. And what can <i>I</i> do? He ain&#8217;t any
too friendly with <i>me</i> yet? So be keerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Doc,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;don&#8217;t you go to
worryin&#8217; about me. Just you help by <i>prescribin&#8217;
that medicine.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To folks that don&#8217;t need none?&#8221; ast Billy.
&#8220;Aw, I don&#8217;t like to.&#8221; (Billy&#8217;s awful white, Billy
is.) &#8220;It won&#8217;t do &#8217;em no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;it won&#8217;t do &#8217;em no <i>harm.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy said he&#8217;d see.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could let it out that somebody in town&#8217;s
been cured by the stuff,&#8221; I suggests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only make them railroad fellers buy more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Wal, I guess the best thing fer me
to do is to hunt up people with a misery and tell
&#8217;em they&#8217;d better buy&#8211;and vote my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy throwed back his haid and haw-hawed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a <i>dickens</i> of a feller!&#8221; he says. &#8220;When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
you want to have you&#8217; own way, I never seen <i>any</i>-body
that could think up more gol-darned
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; I <i>con</i>tinues, &#8220;if that Root-ee just had
a lot of forty-rod mixed in it, it &#8217;d be easier&#8217;n all
git out to talk fellers into takin&#8217; it. If they&#8217;d
try <i>one</i> bottle, they&#8217;d shore take <i>another.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Cupid,&#8221; says Billy, like he was goin&#8217; to
scolt me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;R if ole man Baker &#8217;d take the stuff and git
his hearin&#8217; back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No show. Nothin&#8217; but sproutin&#8217; a new ear&#8217;d
help Baker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next person I seen was that Doc Simpson.
He was a-settin&#8217; on Silverstein&#8217;s porch, teeterin&#8217;
hisself in a chair. &#8220;Billy,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
over to put that critter up to buyin&#8217;. He&#8217;s got
money and he cain&#8217;t do better&#8217;n spend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, a-course, Simpson was turrible uppy
when I first spoke to him. Said he didn&#8217;t want
nothin&#8217; t&#8217; say to me&#8211;not a <i>word</i>. (He had sev&#8217;ral
risin&#8217;s on his face yet.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Doc,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I know you think I
didn&#8217;t treat you square, <i>but</i>&#8211;has you city fellers
any idear how mad you make us folks in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
country when you go a-shootin&#8217; &#8217;round in them
gasoline rigs of yourn? Why, I think if you&#8217;ll
give this question some little study, you&#8217;ll see it
has got two sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; says the Doc, &#8220;it <i>has</i>. But that ain&#8217;t
why you treated <i>me</i> like you did. No, I ain&#8217;t
green enough to think <i>that.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t green at <i>all,</i>&#8221; I says. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
shore sorry you feel the way you do. &#8217;Cause I
hoped mebbe you&#8217;d fergit our little trouble and
bury the hatchet&#8211;long as we&#8217;re both workin&#8217; fer
the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What thing, I&#8217;d like t&#8217; know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, gittin&#8217; Miss Macie Sewell elected the
prettiest gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fer a bit he didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. Then he made
some <i>re</i>mark about a gal&#8217;s name bein&#8217; &#8220;handed
&#8217;round town,&#8221; and that a votin&#8217; contest was &#8220;vulgar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, he put it so slick that I didn&#8217;t just git the
hang of what he was drivin&#8217; at. Just the same, I
felt he was layin&#8217; it on to me, somehow. And if
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been <i>shore</i> of it, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; put some <i>more</i>
risin&#8217;s on to his face.</p>

<p>Wisht now I had&#8211;on gen&#8217;ral principles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
&#8217;Cause, thinkin&#8217; back, I know <i>just</i> what he done.
If he didn&#8217;t, why was him and that Root-ee
Judge talkin&#8217; t&#8217;gether so long at the door of Silverstein&#8217;s
Hall&#8211;talkin&#8217; like they was thick, and
laughin&#8217;, and ev&#8217;ry oncet in a while lookin&#8217; over
at me?</p>

<p>I drummed up a lot of votes that afternoon.
Got holt of Buckshot Milliken, who wasn&#8217;t feelin&#8217;
more&#8217;n ordinary good. Ast him how he was. He
put his hand to his belt, screwed up his mug, and
said he felt plumb et up inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buckshot,&#8221; I says, &#8220;anybody else &#8217;d give you
that ole sickenin&#8217; story about it bein&#8217; the nose-paint
you swallered last night. Reckon you&#8217;
wife&#8217;s tole you that a&#8217;ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she has,&#8221; growls Buckshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, <i>I</i> knowed it! But is she <i>right?</i> Now, <i>I</i>
think, Buckshot,&#8211;I think you&#8217;ve got the bliggers.&#8221;
(Made it up on the spot.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The bliggers!&#8221; he says, turrible scairt-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think. But all you need is that
Root-ee they sell over yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>He perked up. &#8220;Shore of it?&#8221; he ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy a bottle and try. And leave off drinkin&#8217;
anythin&#8217; else whilst you&#8217;re takin&#8217; the stuff, so&#8217;s it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
can have a fair chanst. In a week, you&#8217;ll be a new
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he says, makin&#8217; fer that prairie-schooner.</p>

<p>I calls after him: &#8220;And say, Buckshot, ev&#8217;ry
two dollars you spend with them people, you git
the right to put in ten votes fer the prettiest gal.
Now, most of us is votin&#8217; fer ole man Sewell&#8217;s
youngest daughter.&#8221; Then, like I was tryin&#8217; hard
to recollect, &#8220;I <i>think</i> her name is Macie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Cupid. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seen Sewell a little bit later. And braced right
up to him. &#8217;Cause fer two reasons: First, I
wanted <i>him</i> t&#8217; do some buyin&#8217; fer his gal; then, I
wanted t&#8217; find out if he didn&#8217;t need another
puncher out at the Bar Y. (Ketch on t&#8217; my little
game?)</p>

<p>The ole man was pretty short, and wouldn&#8217;t do
a livin&#8217; lick about them votes. Said <i>he</i> knowed
his gal, Mace, was the prettiest gal in Oklahomaw,
and it didn&#8217;t need no passel of breeds &#8217;r
quacks to cut her out of the bunch of heifers and
give her the brand.</p>

<p>Then, I says, &#8220;S&#8217;pose you ain&#8217;t lookin&#8217; fer no
extra punchers out at the Bar Y? I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
some of quittin&#8217; where I am.&#8221; (&#8217;Twixt you and
me and the gate-post, I knowed from Hairoil
that the Sewell outfit was shy two men&#8211;just
when men was wanted <i>bad</i>.)</p>

<p>Fer a minute, Sewell didn&#8217;t answer anothin&#8217;.
(Stiff-necked, y&#8217; savvy,&#8211;see a feller dead first
&#8217;fore he&#8217;d give in a&#8217; inch.) Pretty soon, he looked
up, kinda sheepish. &#8220;I <i>could</i> use another puncher,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;t&#8217; ride line. Forty suit y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shore, boss. Be out the first. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was goin&#8217; to the Bar Y, where <i>she</i> was! Wal,
mebbe I wasn&#8217;t happy! And mebbe I wasn&#8217;t set
worse&#8217;n ever on havin&#8217; the little gal win in that
contest! &#8217;Fore night, I rounded up as many as
five people that had a bony fido grunt comin&#8217;, and
was glad to hear the grand things Doc Trowbridge
said about Root-ee!</p>

<p>When the show started up in the hall after supper,
and I slid in to take my seat in the winda, a
lot of people,&#8211;women and kids and men&#8211;kinda
turned round towards me and whispered and
grinned. &#8220;They know I&#8217;m fer Macie Sewell,&#8221; I
says to myself, &#8220;but that don&#8217;t bother <i>me</i> none.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Blackfoot Injun (he was turned into
To-Ko, the Human Snake) was a-throwin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
squaw-hitches with hisself. The Judge come to
the edge of the platform and pointed over his
shoulder to him. &#8220;Do you think he could do that
if he didn&#8217;t rub his hinges with Pain Balm?&#8221; he
says. &#8220;Wal, he couldn&#8217;t. Pain Balm makes a
man as limber as a willa. Ladies and gents, it&#8217;s
<i>won</i>derful what that remedy can do! It&#8217;ll prolong
you&#8217; life, make you healthy, wealthy, happy,
and wise. Here you get the Blackfoot Injun
Root-ee, the Pain Balm, the Cough Balsam, the
Magic Salve, and the Worm Destroyer,&#8211;the
fi-i-ive remedies fer two dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! it made my jaw plumb tired t&#8217; listen to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hairoil,&#8221; I says to Johnson, &#8220;they got the
names of the prettiest gals up on the blackboard,
but where&#8217;s the names of the homeliest men?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil snickered a little. Then he pulled his
face straight and said that, bein&#8217; as Monkey Mike
&#8217;d kicked up a turrible fuss about the votes that
was cast fer <i>him,</i> why, the Judge had <i>de</i>cided to
keep the homeliest-man contest a secret.</p>

<p>Wal, <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t keer. Was only a-botherin&#8217; my,
haid over the way the prettiest gal countin&#8217; &#8217;d
come out. I got holt of Dutchy, who &#8217;d come in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
from his thirst-parlour to look on a minute.
&#8220;Buyin&#8217;, Dutchy?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I reckon you need Root-ee, all the same.
Do you ever feel kinda full and stuffy after
meals?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t that show! Dutchy, I&#8217;m sorry,
but it&#8217;s a cinch you got the bliggers!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, <i>he</i> bit.</p>

<p>The station-agent was standin&#8217; right next me.
&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he whispers, &#8220;I hear you got a candi-<i>date</i>
in fer the prettiest gal. What you say about
runnin&#8217; as the homeliest man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answers, quick, &#8220;I don&#8217;t hanker fer
the honour. (That &#8217;d hurt me with <i>her,</i> y&#8217;
savvy.) Then, I begun chinnin&#8217; with Sparks, that
owns the corral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great stuff, that Root-ee,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Reckon
the redskins knowed a heap more about curin&#8217;
than anybody&#8217;s ever give &#8217;em credit fer. Tried
the medicine yet, Sparks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sparks said no, he didn&#8217;t think he needed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, a man never knows,&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;Now,
mebbe, of a mornin&#8217;, when you wake up, you feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
tired and sorta stretchy; wisht you could just roll
over and take another snooze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t right, Sparks.&#8221; And I turned in
and give him that bliggers talk.</p>

<p>But he hung off till I tole him about the scheme
of the railroad bunch. Seems that Sparks had a
grudge agin the eatin&#8217;-house &#8217;cause it wouldn&#8217;t
give him train-men&#8217;s rates fer grub. So he fell
right into line.</p>

<p>Macie Sewell didn&#8217;t come to the show that
night, so I didn&#8217;t stay long. Over to the bunk-house,
I got a piece of paper and some ink and
(ain&#8217;t ashamed of it, <i>neither,</i>) writ down her
name. Under it, I put mine. Then, after crossin&#8217;
out all the letters that was alike, and countin&#8217;
&#8220;Friendship, love, indiff&#8217;rence, hate, courtship,
marriage,&#8221; it looked like this:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-075.jpg' alt='code' />
</div>

<p>By jingo, I reckon it stood just about that way!</p>

<p>Next mornin&#8217;, whilst I was standin&#8217; outside the
post-office, she come ridin&#8217; up! Say, all to oncet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
my heart got to goin&#8217; somethin&#8217; turrible&#8211;I was
feard she&#8217;d hear it, no josh. My hands felt weak,
too, so&#8217;s I could hardly pull off my Stetson; and
my ears got red; and my tongue thick, like the
time I got offen the trail in Arizonaw and din&#8217;t
have no water fer two &#8217;r three days.</p>

<p>She seen me, and smiled, sorta bashful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sewell,&#8221; I says, &#8220;can I ast fer you&#8217;
mail? Then you won&#8217;t have to git down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, thank y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I give it to her, I got my sand back a
little. &#8220;I hope,&#8221; I says, &#8220;that you didn&#8217;t mind
my puttin&#8217; you&#8217; name up in that votin&#8217; contest.
Did y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8211;why, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awful glad. And I&#8217;m a-comin&#8217; out to the
Bar Y the first to ride line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are y&#8217;?&#8221; Them pink cheeks of hern got
pinker&#8217;n ever, and when she loped off, she smiled
back at me!</p>

<p>Say! I never was so happy in all my life! I
went to work gittin&#8217; votes fer her, feelin&#8217; like
ev&#8217;rybody was my friend&#8211;even ole Skinflint
Curry, that I&#8217;d had words with oncet. That railroad
bunch was a-workin&#8217;, too, and a-talkin&#8217; up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Mollie Brown. And I heerd that they planned to
hole back a lot of votes till Macie Sewell&#8217;s count
was all in, and then spring &#8217;em to elect the other
gal. That got me worried some.</p>

<p>About six o&#8217;clock, one of them fancy vests went
&#8217;round town, hollerin&#8217; it out that the show &#8217;d give
its last performance that night. &#8220;What&#8217;s you
sweat?&#8221; I ast him. Nothin&#8217;, he says, only the
Judge reckoned about all the folks that intended
to buy Root-ee had bought a&#8217;ready.</p>

<p>Wal, the show got a turrible big crowd&#8211;hall
chuch full. And I tell y&#8217; things was livelier&#8217;n they
was at the dawg fight. The Mollie Brown crowd
was rushin&#8217; &#8217;round and lookin&#8217; corkin&#8217; shore, and
the punchers holdin&#8217; up people as they come in,
and the Marvellous Murray&#8217;s doin&#8217; anty-I-overs
with theyselves plumb acrosst the stage.</p>

<p>All the time, the Judge was exercisin&#8217; that jaw
of hisn. &#8220;Ladies and gents,&#8221; he says, (banjo
goin&#8217; ev&#8217;ry minute) &#8220;here&#8217;s where you git cured
whilst you stand&#8211;like buffalo grass. Don&#8217;t you
be scairt that you&#8217;ll buy me out&#8211;I got more down
cellar in a teacup!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then <i>she</i> come in, and I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; pulled
outen that place fer a new dollar. She looked so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
cool and pretty, that little haid up, and a wisp of
hair blowin&#8217; agin her one cheek &#8217;cause they was a
breeze from the windas. Simpson was with her.
What did <i>I</i> keer! She wasn&#8217;t noticin&#8217; <i>him</i> much.
Wal, I just never looked anywheres else but at
her. Aw, I hoped that pretty soon she&#8217;d look
round at me!</p>

<p>She did!&#8211;straighter&#8217;n a string. And the hull
room got as misty and full of roarin&#8217; as if a Santa
Fee ingine was in there, a-leakin&#8217; steam. I tried
t&#8217; smile at her. But my face seemed hard, like a
piece of leather. I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> smile.</p>

<p>Then, my eyes cleared. And I seen she was
sad, like as if somethin&#8217; was botherin&#8217; her mind.
&#8220;She thinks she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; git beat,&#8221; I says to
myself. &#8220;But she <i>ain&#8217;t.</i>&#8221; And I reached down to
see if my pop-gun was all right.</p>

<p>She turned back towards the stage. The Murray
woman &#8217;d just finished one of them songs of
hern, and the Judge was talkin&#8217; again. &#8220;Ladies
and gents,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we shall not drag out our
pro<i>gram</i> too long. Fer the reason that I know
just what you-all want to hear <i>most</i>. And that is,
the <i>re</i>sult of the contest.&#8221;</p>

<p>That railroad gang begun t&#8217; holler.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>Don&#8217;t know why,&#8211;wasn&#8217;t no reason fer it, but
my heart went plumb down into my boots. &#8220;Aw,
little Macie!&#8221; I says to myself; &#8220;aw, little Macie!&#8221;
Say! I come mighty nigh prayin&#8217; over it!</p>

<p>&#8220;The count fer the prettiest gal,&#8221; goes on the
Judge, &#8220;is complete. Miss de Mille, kindly bring
for&#8217;ard the watch. I shall have to ast some gent
to escort the fortu<i>nate</i> young lady to the platform.&#8221;
(I seen a brakeman start over to Mollie
Brown.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend&#8221;&#8211;the Judge again&#8211;&#8220;to keep
you in suspenders no longer. And I reckon you&#8217;ll
all be glad to know&#8221; (here he give a bow) &#8220;that
the winner is&#8211;Miss Macie Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, us punchers let out a yell that plumb
cracked the ceiling. &#8220;Wow! wow! <i>wow!</i> Macie
Sewell!&#8221; And we whistled, and kicked the floor,
and banged the benches, and whooped.</p>

<p>Doctor Bugs got to his feet, puttin&#8217; his stylish
hat and gloves on his chair, and crookin&#8217; a&#8217; elbow.
Wal, I reckon <i>this</i> part wasn&#8217;t vulgar!</p>

<p>Then, <i>she</i> stood up, took holt of his arm, and
stepped out into the aisle. She was smilin&#8217; a little,
but kinda sober yet, I thought. She went towards
the Judge slow, and up the steps. He helt out his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
hand. &#8220;With the compliments of the company,&#8221;
he says. She took the watch. Then she turned.</p>

<p>Another cheer&#8211;a <i>whopper</i>.</p>

<p>She stood there, lookin&#8217; like a&#8217; angel, &#8217;r a bird,
&#8217;r a little bobbin&#8217; rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217;, boys,&#8221; she says; &#8220;thank y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; knowed what was a-goin&#8217; to happen
next, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; slid out then. But, a-course, I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; says the Judge, &#8220;I will now
read the vote for the homeliest man. Monkey
Mike received the large count of twenty. But it
stands nineteen hunderd and sixty fer&#8211;Cupid
Lloyd.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of a suddent two &#8217;r three fellers had holt of
me. And they was a big yell went up&#8211;&#8220;Cupid!
Cupid! The homeliest man! Whee!&#8221; The next
second, I was goin&#8217; for&#8217;ards, but shovin&#8217; back. I
<i>hated</i> to have her see me made a fool of. I seen
red, I was so mad. I could &#8217;a&#8217; kilt. But she was
lookin&#8217; at me, and I was as helpless as a little cat.
I put down my haid, and was just kinda dragged
up the aisle and onto the platform.</p>

<p>She went down the steps to her seat then. But
she didn&#8217;t stop. She bent over, picked up her
jacket, whispered somethin&#8217; to Rose and, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
that Simpson trailin&#8217;, went to the back of the
hall. There she stopped, kinda half turned, and
waited.</p>

<p>I wisht fer a knot-hole that I could crawl
through. I wisht a crack in the floor &#8217;d open and
let me slip down, no matter if I tumbled into a
barrel of <i>mo</i>lasses below in Silverstein&#8217;s. I wisht
I was dead, and I wisht the hull blamed bunch of
punchers was&#8211;Wal, I felt something <i>turrible</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid!&#8221; &#8220;You blamed fool!&#8221; &#8220;Look at
him, boys!&#8221; &#8220;Take his picture!&#8221; &#8220;Say! he&#8217;s a
beauty!&#8221; Then they hollered like they&#8217;d bust they
sides, and stomped.</p>

<p>I laughed, a-course,&#8211;sickish, though.</p>

<p>The Judge, I reckon, felt kinda &#8217;shamed of
hisself. &#8217;Cause I&#8217;d helped to sell a heap of medicine,
and he knowed it. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Lloyd,&#8221;
he says; &#8220;they ain&#8217;t no present fer you. You can
vamose&#8211;back stairway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee-oop!&#8221; goes the boys.</p>

<p>I seen her start down then. Billy and his wife
got up, too. So did the crowd, still a-laughin&#8217; and
a-hootin&#8217;.</p>

<p>I kinda backed a bit. When I reached the
stairs, I went slower, feelin&#8217; my way. Minute and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
I come out onto Silverstein&#8217;s hind porch. Nobody
was there, so I went over to the edge and
lent agin a&#8217; upright.</p>

<p>Right back of Silverstein&#8217;s they&#8217;s a line of
hitchin&#8217;-posts. Two hosses was fastened there
when I come, but it was so dark, and I felt so
kinda bad, that I didn&#8217;t notice the broncs par<i>tic</i>-ular.
Till, &#8217;round the corner, towards &#8217;em, come
that Simpson. Next, walkin&#8217; slow and lookin&#8217;
down&#8211;Macie.</p>

<p>But she got onto her hoss quick, and without no
help. All the time, Bugsey was a-fussin&#8217; with his
mustang. But the critter was nervous, and wasn&#8217;t
no easy job. Macie waited. She was nighest to
me, and right in line with the light from a winda.
I could see her face plain. But I couldn&#8217;t tell how
she was feelin&#8217;,&#8211;put out, &#8217;r quiet, &#8217;r just kinda
tired.</p>

<p>Simpson got into the saddle then, his hoss
rearin&#8217; and runnin&#8217;. He could steer a gasoline
wagon, but he couldn&#8217;t handle a cayuse. He
turned to holler: &#8220;Comin&#8217;, Miss Sewell?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said she was, but she started awful slow,
and kinda peered back, and up to the hall. At
the same time, she must &#8217;a&#8217; saw that they was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
man on the back porch, &#8217;cause she pulled in a
little, lookin&#8217; hard.</p>

<p>I felt that rope a-drawin&#8217; me then. I couldn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; kept myself from goin&#8217; to her. I started down.
&#8220;Miss Macie!&#8221; I says; &#8220;Miss Macie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8211;why, Mister Lloyd!&#8221; She wheeled
her hoss. &#8220;Is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I went acrosst the yard to where she was.
&#8220;Yas,&#8211;it&#8217;s me,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>She lent down towards me a little. &#8220;You been
awful good to me,&#8221; she says. &#8220;<i>I</i> know. It was
<i>you</i> got all them votes. Hairoil said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8211;and&#8221;&#8211;I heerd her breath &#8217;way deep,
kinda like a sob&#8211;&#8220;you <i>ain&#8217;t</i> the homeliest man!
you <i>ain&#8217;t!</i> Aw, it was <i>mean</i> of &#8217;em! And it
hurt<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it didn&#8217;t&#8211;please, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurt&#8211;me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That put the cheek of ten men into me. I
Straightened up, and I lifted my chin. &#8220;Why,
Gawd <i>bless</i> you, little gal!&#8221; I says. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
<i>right.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Her one hand was a-restin&#8217; on the pommel. I
reached up&#8211;only a stay-chain could a&#8217; helt me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
back then&#8211;and took it into both of mine. Say!
did you ever holt a little, flutterin&#8217; bird &#8217;twixt
you&#8217; two palms?</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie,&#8221; I says, &#8220;Macie Sewell.&#8221; And I
pressed her hand agin my face.</p>

<p>She lent towards me again. It wasn&#8217;t more&#8217;n a
soft breath, and I could hardly hear. But nobody
but me and that little ole bronc of hern&#8217;ll ever
know what it was she said.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER FOUR<br /><span class='h2fs'>CONCERIN&#8217; THE SHERIFF AND ANOTHER LITTLE WIDDA</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Aw</span>! them first days out at the Bar Y ranch-house!&#8211;them
first days! <i>No</i>body could &#8217;a&#8217; been
happier&#8217;n I was then.</p>

<p>I hit the ranch on a Friday, about six in the
evenin&#8217;, it was, I reckon,&#8211;in time fer supper,
anyhow. The punchers et in a room acrosst the
kitchen from where the fambly et. And I recollect
that sometimes durin&#8217; that meal, as the Chink
come outen the kitchen, totin&#8217; grub to us, I just
could ketch sight of Macie&#8217;s haid in the far room,
bobbin&#8217; over her plate. And ev&#8217;ry time I&#8217;d see
her, I&#8217;d git so blamed flustered that my knife &#8217;d
miss my mouth and jab me in the jaw, &#8217;r else I&#8217;d
spill somethin&#8217; &#8217;r other on to Monkey Mike.</p>

<p>And after supper, when the sun was down, and
they was just a kinda half-light on the mesquite,
and the ole man was on the east porch, smokin&#8217;,
and the boys was all lined up along the front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
the bunk-house, clean outen sight of the far side
of the yard, why, I just sorta wandered over to
the calf-corral, then &#8217;round by the barn and the
Chink&#8217;s shack, and landed up out to the west,
where they&#8217;s a row of cottonwoods by the new irrigatin&#8217;
ditch. Beyond, acrosst about a hunderd
mile of brown plain, here was the moon a-risin&#8217;,
bigger&#8217;n a dish-pan, and a cold white. I stood agin
a tree and watched it crawl through the clouds.
The frogs was a-watchin&#8217;, too, I reckon, fer they
begun to holler like the dickens, some bass and
some squeaky. And then, from the other side of
the ranch-house, struck up a mouth-organ:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p class='i'>&#8220;Sweet is the vale where the Mohawk gently glides</p>
<p class='i'>On its fair, windin&#8217; way to the sea<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A wait&#8211;ten seconds &#8217;r so (it seemed longer);
then, the same part of the song, over again,
and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>Outen the side door of the porch next me come
a slim, little figger in white. It stepped down
where some sun-flowers was a-growin&#8217; agin the
wall. Say! it was just sunflower high! Then it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
come acrosst the alfalfa&#8211;like a butterfly. And
then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want a shawl &#8217;round you&#8217; shoulders,
honey? It&#8217;s some chilly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; (Did you ever see a gal that&#8217;d own up
she needed a wrap?)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, you got to have <i>somethin&#8217;</i> &#8217;round you.&#8221;
And so I helt her clost, and put my hand under
her chin t&#8217; tip it so&#8217;s I could see her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>mustn&#8217;t,</i> Alec!&#8221; (She was allus shy
about bein&#8217; kissed.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I tole Mike to give me ten minutes&#8217; lee-way
&#8217;fore he played that tune. But he must &#8217;a&#8217; waited
a hull hour.&#8221; And then, with the mouth-organ
goin&#8217; at the bunk-house (t&#8217; keep the ole man listenin&#8217;,
y&#8217; savvy, and make him fergit t&#8217; look fer
Mace), we rambled north byside the ditch, holdin&#8217;
each other&#8217;s hand as we walked, like two kids.
And the ole moon, it smiled down on us, awful
friendly like, and we smiled back at the moon.</p>

<p>Wal, when we figgered that Mike &#8217;d blowed
hisself plumb outen breath, we started home
again. And under the cottonwoods, the little
gal reached up her two arms t&#8217; me; and they
wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but love in them sweet, grey eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t never liked nobody else, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;just you, Alec!&#8211;<i>dear</i> Alec!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here, Macie,&#8211;and this is fer keeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, &#8217;most ev&#8217;ry night it was just like that.
And the follerin&#8217; day, mebbe I wouldn&#8217;t know
whether I was a-straddle of a hoss, drivin&#8217;
steers, &#8217;r a-straddle of a steer, drivin&#8217; hosses.
And it&#8217;s a blamed good thing my bronc savvied
how t&#8217; tend to business without <i>me</i> doin&#8217; much!</p>

<p>Then, mebbe, I&#8217;d be ridin&#8217; line. Maud &#8217;d go
weavin&#8217; away up the long fence that leads towards
Kansas, and at sundown we&#8217;d reach the
first line-shack. And there, with the little bronc
a-pickin&#8217;, and my coffee a-coolin&#8217; byside me on a
bench, I&#8217;d sit out under the sky and watch the
moon&#8211;alone. Mebbe, when I got home, it &#8217;d
be ole man Sewell&#8217;s lodge-night, so he&#8217;d start fer
town &#8217;long about seven o&#8217;clock, and Mace and
me &#8217;d have the porch to ourselves&#8211;the side-porch,
where the sun-flowers growed. But the next
night, we&#8217;d meet by the ditch again, and the
next, and the next. Aw! them first happy days
at the ole Bar Y!</p>

<p>And I reckon it was just <i>&#8217;cause</i> we was so turrible
happy that we got inter<i>ested</i> in Bergin&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
case&#8211;Mace and me both. (Next t&#8217; Hairoil,
Bergin&#8217;s my best friend, y&#8217; savvy.) Figgerin&#8217;
on how t&#8217; fix things up fer him&#8211;speakin&#8217; matreemonal&#8211;brung
us two closter t&#8217;gether, and
showed me what a <i>dandy</i> little pardner she was
a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; make.</p>

<p>But I want t&#8217; say right here that we wasn&#8217;t <i>re</i>-sponsible
fer the way that case of hisn turned out&#8211;and neither was <i>no other livin&#8217; soul. No,</i>
ma&#8217;am. The hull happenstance was the kind that
a feller cain&#8217;t <i>ex</i>plain.</p>

<p>It begun when I&#8217;d been out at the Sewell
ranch about two weeks. (I disremember the exac&#8217;
day, but <i>that</i> don&#8217;t matter.) I&#8217;d rid in town
fer somethin&#8217;, and was a-crossin&#8217; by the deepot
t&#8217; git it, when I ketched sight of Bergin a-settin&#8217;
on the end of a truck,&#8211;all by hisself. Now,
that was funny, &#8217;cause they wasn&#8217;t a man in
Briggs City but liked George Bergin and would
&#8217;a&#8217; hoofed it a mile to talk to him. &#8220;What&#8217;s
skew-gee?&#8221; I says to myself, and looked at him
clost; then,&#8211;&#8220;Csar Augustus Philabustus
Hennery Jinks!&#8221; I kinda gasped, and brung
up so suddent that I bit my cigareet clean in two
and come nigh turnin&#8217; a somerset over back&#8217;ards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>White as that paper, he was, and nervous, and
so all-fired shaky and caved-in that they couldn&#8217;t
be no question what was the matter. <i>The
sheriff was scairt.</i></p>

<p>First off, I wasn&#8217;t hardly able to believe what
I seen with my own <i>eyes</i>. Next, I begun to
think &#8217;round fer the cause why. Didn&#8217;t have to
think much. Knowed they wasn&#8217;t a <i>pinch</i> of
&#8217;fraid-cat in Bergin&#8211;no crazy-drunk greaser &#8217;r
no passel of bad men, <i>red</i> &#8217;r white, could put <i>him</i>
in a sweat, <i>no,</i> sir-<i>ree</i>. They was just <i>one</i> thing
on earth could stampede the sheriff. I kinda
tip-toed over to him. &#8220;Bergin,&#8221; I says, &#8220;<i>who is
she?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up&#8211;slow. He&#8217;s a six-footer, and
about as heavy-set as the bouncer over to the
eatin&#8217;-house. Wal, I&#8217;m another if ev&#8217;ry square
inch of him wasn&#8217;t tremblin&#8217;, and his teeth was
chatterin&#8217; so hard I looked to see &#8217;em fall out&#8211;that&#8217;s
<i>straight</i>. Them big, blue eyes of hisn
was sunk &#8217;way back in his haid, too, and the rest
of his face looked like it &#8217;d got in the way of the
hose. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;you&#8217;ve struck
it! Here&#8211;read this.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a telegram. Say, you know I ain&#8217;t got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
<i>no</i> use fer telegrams. The blamed things <i>allus</i>
give y&#8217; a dickens of a start, and, nine times outen
ten, they&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; to say that no man
wants to hear. But I opened it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;sheriff george bergin,&#8221; it read,&#8211;all little letters,
y&#8217; savvy. (Say! what&#8217;s the matter that
they cain&#8217;t send no capitals over the wire?)
&#8220;briggs city oklahomaw meet mrs bridger number
201 friday phillips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw,&#8221; I says, &#8220;Mrs. Bridger. Wal, Sheriff,
who&#8217;s this Mrs. Bridger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pore Bergin just wagged his haid. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to give me a goose-aig on that one,&#8221; he
answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, who&#8217;s Phillips, then?&#8221; I <i>con</i>tinued.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sante Fee deepot-master at Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means you needn&#8217;t to worry. Mrs.
Bridger is likely comin&#8217; on to boss the gals at the
eatin&#8217;-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, what &#8217;d he telegraph to <i>me</i> fer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Buck up, anyhow. I&#8217;ll bet
she&#8217;s gone <i>&#8217;way</i> past the poll-tax age, and has
got a face like a calf with a blab on its nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; says the sheriff, standin&#8217; up,
&#8220;thank y&#8217;. I feel better. Was worried &#8217;cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
I&#8217;ve had bad luck lately, and bad luck most allus
runs in threes. Last week, my dawg died&#8211;remember
that one with a buck tooth? I was
turrible fond of that dawg. And yesterday<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped then, and a new crop of drops
come out on to his face. &#8220;Look!&#8221; he says,
hoarse like, and pointed.</p>

<p>&#8217;Way off to the north was a little, dark, puffy
cloud. It was a-travelin&#8217; our <i>di</i>rection. Number
201!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; says the sheriff, and sunk down on
to the truck again.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t leave him. I recollected what happened
that time he captured &#8220;Cud&#8221; and Andy
Foster and brung &#8217;em into town, his hat shot off
and his left arm a-hangin&#8217; floppy agin his laig.
Y&#8217; see, next day, a bunch of ladies&#8211;<i>ole</i> ladies,
they was, too,&#8211;tried to find him and give him a
vote of thanks. But when he seen &#8217;em comin&#8217;,
he swore in a deputy&#8211;<i>quick</i>&#8211;and vamosed.
Day &#8217;r two afterwards, here he come outen that
cellar back of Dutchy&#8217;s thirst-parlour, his left
arm in a red bandaner, a rockin&#8217;-chair and a pilla
under his right one, and a lantern in his teeth!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>But <i>this</i> time, he wasn&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to <i>have</i> no
deputy. I made up my mind to stay right byside
him till he&#8217;d did his duty. Yas, ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he begun again, reachin&#8217; fer my
fist, &#8220;Cupid, when it comes to feemales<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Too-oo-oot! too-oo-oot!</i> Couldn&#8217;t make him
hear, so I just slapped him on the shoulder.
Then I hauled him up, and we went down the
platform to where the crowd was.</p>

<p>When the train slowed down, the first thing I
seen was the conductor with a kid in his arms,&#8211;a
cute kid, about four, I reckon,&#8211;a boy. Then
the cars stopped, and I seen a woman standin&#8217;
just behind them. Next, they was all out on to
the platform, and the woman was holdin&#8217; the kid
by one hand.</p>

<p>The woman was cute, too. Mebbe thirty,
mebbe less, light-complected, yalla-haired, kinda
plump, and about so high. Not pretty like
Mace &#8217;r Carlota Arnaz, but <i>mighty</i> good t&#8217; look
at. Blabbed calf? Say! this was <i>awful!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Ber-r-gin!&#8221; hollers the corn-doc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bergin,&#8221; I repeats, encouragin&#8217;. (Hope I
never see a man look worse. He was all blue
and green!)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>Bergin, he just kinda staggered up. He&#8217;d
had <i>one</i> look, y&#8217; savvy. Wal, he didn&#8217;t look no
more. Pulled off his Stetson, though. Then
he smoothed the cow-lick over his one eye, and
sorta studied the kid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheriff,&#8221; goes on the corn-doc, &#8220;here&#8217;s a
lady that has been <i>con</i>signed to you&#8217; care.
Good-bye, ma&#8217;am, it&#8217;s been a pleasure to look out
fer you. Good-bye, little feller,&#8221; (this to the
kid). &#8220;Aw-aw-awl abroad!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Number 201 pulled out, you can bet you&#8217;
little Cupid helt on to that sheriff! &#8220;Bergin,&#8221;
I says, under my breath, &#8220;fer heaven&#8217;s sake, remember
you&#8217; oath of office! And, <i>boys,</i>&#8221;
(they was about a dozen cow-punchers behind
us, a-smilin&#8217; at Mrs. Bridger so hard that they
plumb laid they faces open) &#8220;you&#8217;ll have us all
shoved on to the tracks in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the kid that helped out. He&#8217;d been
lookin&#8217; up at Bergin ever since he hit the station.
Now, all to oncet, he reached towards the sheriff
with both his little hands&#8211;as friendly as if he&#8217;d
knowed him all his life.</p>

<p>Y&#8217; know, Bergin&#8217;s heart &#8217;s as big as a&#8217; ox.
He&#8217;s tender and <i>awful</i> kind, and kids like him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
straight off. He likes kids. So, &#8217;fore you
could say Jack Robinson, that Bridger young
un was histed up. I nodded to his maw, and the
four of us went into the eatin&#8217;-house, where we
all had some dinner t&#8217;gether. Leastways, me
and the kid and Mrs. Bridger et. The sheriff,
he just sit, not sayin&#8217; a word, but pullin&#8217; at that
cow-lick of hisn and orderin&#8217; things fer the baby.
And whilst we grubbed, Mrs. Bridger tole us
about herself, and how she &#8217;d happened to come
out Oklahomaw way.</p>

<p>Seems she &#8217;d been livin&#8217; in Buffalo, where her
husband was the boss of a lumber-yard. Wal,
when the kid was three years old, Bridger up and
died, not leavin&#8217; much in the way of cash fer the
widda. Then she had to begin plannin&#8217; how to
git along, a-course. Chicken-ranchin&#8217; got into
her haid. Somebody said Oklahomaw was a good
place. She got the name of a land-owner in
Briggs City and writ him. He tole her he had a
nice forty acres fer sale&#8211;hunderd down, the balance
later on. She bit&#8211;and here she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the man?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>The widda pulled a piece of paper outen her
hand-satchel. &#8220;Frank Curry,&#8221; she answers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>Bergin give a jump that come nigh to tippin&#8217;
the table over. (Ole Skinflint Curry was the
reason.)</p>

<p>&#8220;And where&#8217;s the ranch?&#8221; I ast again.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where.&#8221; She handed me the paper.</p>

<p>I read. &#8220;Why, Bergin,&#8221; I says, &#8220;it&#8217;s that
place right here below town, back of the section-house&#8211;the
Starvation Gap Ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff throwed me a quick look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; begun the widda, leanin&#8217; towards
him, &#8220;&#8211;I hope they&#8217;s nothin&#8217; <i>agin</i> the property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fer as much as half a minute, neither of us
said nothin&#8217;. The sheriff, a-course, was turrible
flustered &#8217;cause she &#8217;d spoke <i>di</i>rect to him, and he
just jiggled his knee. <i>I</i> was kinda bothered, too,
and got some coffee down my Sunday throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, as a <i>chicken</i> ranch,&#8221; I puts in fin&#8217;lly
&#8220;it&#8217;s O. K.,&#8211;shore <i>thing</i>. On both sides of the
house&#8211;see? like this,&#8221; (I took a fork and begun
drawin&#8217; on the table-cloth) &#8220;is a stretch of
low ground,&#8211;a swale, like, that keeps green fer
a week &#8217;r so ev&#8217;ry year, and that&#8217;ll raise Kaffir-corn
and such roughness. You git the tie-houses
of the section-gang plank in front&#8211;here.
But behind, you&#8217; <i>po</i>ssessions rise straight up in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
to the air like the side of a house. Rogers&#8217;s
Butte, they call it. See it, out there? A person
almost has to use a ladder to climb it. On
top, it&#8217;s all piled with big rocks. Of a mornin&#8217;,
the hens can take a trot up it fer exercise. The
fine view &#8217;ll encourage &#8217;em to lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> glad,&#8221; says the widda, kinda clappin&#8217;
her hands. &#8220;I can make enough to support
Willie and me easy. And it&#8217;ll seem awful fine
to have a little home all my own! I ain&#8217;t never
lived in the country afore, but I know it&#8217;ll be
lovely to raise chickens. In pictures, the little
bits of ones is allus so cunnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, I didn&#8217;t answer her. What could I &#8217;a&#8217;
<i>said?</i> And Bergin?&#8211;he come nigh pullin&#8217; his
cow-lick clean out.</p>

<p>By this time, that little kid had his bread-basket
full. So he clumb down outen his chair and
come &#8217;round to the sheriff. Bergin took him on
to his lap. The kid lay back and shut his eyes.
His maw smiled over at Bergin. Bergin smiled
down at the kid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, folks,&#8221; I begun, gittin&#8217; up, &#8220;I&#8217;m turrible
sorry, but I got to tear myself away.
Promised to help the Bar Y boys work a herd.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;<i>Cupid!</i>&#8221; It was the sheriff, voice kinda
croaky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye fer just now, Mrs. Bridger,&#8221; (I
pretended not t&#8217; hear <i>him</i>.) &#8220;So long, Bergin.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I skedaddled.</p>

<p>Two minutes afterwards here they come outen
the eatin&#8217;-house, the widda totin&#8217; a basket and
the sheriff totin&#8217; the kid. I watched &#8217;em through
the crack of Silverstein&#8217;s front door, and I
hummed that good ole song:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p class='i'>&#8220;He never keers to wander from his own fireside;</p>
<p class='i'>He never keers to ramble &#8217;r to roam.</p>
<p class='i'>With his baby on his knee,</p>
<p class='i'>He&#8217;s as happy as can be-e-e,</p>
<p class='i'>Cause they&#8217;s no-o-o place like home, sweet home.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>When I got back to the Bar Y, I was dead
leary about tellin&#8217; Mace that I had half a mind
t&#8217; git Bergin married off. &#8217;Cause, y&#8217; see, I&#8217;d
been made fun of so much fer my Cupid business;
and I hated t&#8217; think of doin&#8217; somethin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
she wouldn&#8217;t like. But, fin&#8217;lly, I managed t&#8217;
spunk up sufficient, and <i>de</i>scribed Mrs. Bridger
and the kid, and said what I&#8217;d like t&#8217; do fer the
sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; says the little gal, &#8220;I been tole (Rose
tole me) how you like t&#8217; help couples that&#8217;s in
love. It&#8217;s what made me first like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honey! Then you&#8217;ll help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Shore,</i> I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>I give her a whoppin&#8217; smack right on that cute,
little, square chin of hern. &#8220;You darlin&#8217;!&#8221; I
says. And then I put another where it&#8217;d do the
most good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says, when she could git a word in
edgeways, &#8220;this widda comin&#8217; is mighty fortu-<i>nate</i>.
Bergin&#8217;s too ole fer the gals at the eatin&#8217;-house.
But Mrs. Bridger&#8217;ll suit. Now, I&#8217;ll lope
down to the Gap right soon t&#8217; visit her, and you
go back t&#8217; town t&#8217; see how him goin&#8217; home with
her come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mace,&#8221; I says, &#8220;if we <i>just</i> can help such a
fine feller t&#8217; git settled. But it&#8217;ll be a job&#8211;a&#8217;
<i>awful</i> job. She&#8217;s a nice, affection<i>ate</i> little thing.
Why, he&#8217;d be a <i>blamed</i> sight happier. And he
likes the kid<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not count our chickens &#8217;fore they
hatch,&#8221; breaks in Mace.</p>

<p>Wal, I hiked fer town, and found the sheriff
right where he was settin&#8217; that mornin&#8217;. But,
say! <i>he was a changed man!</i> No shakin&#8217;, no
caved-in look&#8211;<i>nothin&#8217;</i> of that kind. He was
gazin&#8217; thoughtful at a knot in the deepot platform,
his mouth was part way open, and they
was a sorta sickly grin spread all over them features
of hisn.</p>

<p>I stopped byside him. &#8220;Wal, Sheriff,&#8221; I says,
inquirin&#8217;.</p>

<p>He sit up. &#8220;Aw&#8211;is that you, Cupid?&#8221; he ast.
(I reckon I know a guilty son-of-a-gun when I
see one!)</p>

<p>I sit down on the other end of the truck. &#8220;Did
Mrs. Bridger git settled all right?&#8221; I begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; he answers; &#8220;I pulled the rags outen
the windas, and put some panes of glass in<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Good</i> fer you, Bergin! But, thunder! the
idear of her thinkin&#8217; she can raise chickens fer
a livin&#8217;&#8211;&#8217;way out here. Why, a grasshopper
ranch ain&#8217;t <i>no</i> place fer that little woman.&#8221;
(And I watched sideways to see how he&#8217;d take
it.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Cupid,&#8221; he says. Then, after
swallerin&#8217; hard, &#8220;Did you happen t&#8217; notice how
soft and kinda pinky her hands is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Was that the <i>sheriff</i> talkin&#8217;? Wal, you could
&#8217;a&#8217; knocked me down with a feather!</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, Sheriff,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;I noticed her
pretty par<i>tic</i>ular. And it strikes me that we
needn&#8217;t to worry&#8211;she won&#8217;t stay on that ranch
<i>long</i>. Out here in Oklahomaw, <i>any</i> widda is in
line fer another husband if she&#8217;ll take one. In
Mrs. Bridger&#8217;s case, it won&#8217;t be just any ole
hobo that comes along. She&#8217;ll be able to pick
and choose from a grea-a-at, bi-i-ig bunch. <i>I</i>
seen how the boys acted when she got offen that
train t&#8217;-day&#8211;and I knowed then that it wouldn&#8217;t
be <i>no</i> time till she&#8217;d marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff is tall, as I said afore. Wal, a
kinda shiver went up and down the hull length
of him. Then, he sprung up, givin&#8217; the truck a
kick. &#8220;Marry! marry! marry!&#8221; he begun, grindin&#8217;
his teeth t&#8217;gether. &#8220;Cain&#8217;t you talk nothin&#8217;
<i>else</i> but marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o-ow, Bergin,&#8221; I says, &#8220;what diff&#8217;rence
does it make t&#8217; <i>you?</i> S&#8217;pose she marries, and
s&#8217;pose she don&#8217;t. <i>You</i> don&#8217;t give a bean. Wal, <i>I</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
look at it diff&#8217;rent. <i>I</i> know that nice little kid
of hern needs the keer of a father&#8211;yas, Bergin,
the keer of a <i>father.</i>&#8221; And I looked him square
in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>just</i> like Hairoil says,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;If
Doc Simpson was t&#8217; use a spy-glass on <i>you,</i> he&#8217;d
find you plumb alive with <i>bugs</i>&#8211;<i>marryin&#8217;</i> bugs.
<i>Yas,</i> sir. With you, it&#8217;s a <i>disease.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wal,</i>&#8221; I answers, &#8220;don&#8217;t git anxious that
it&#8217;s ketchin&#8217;. You? Huh! If I had anythin&#8217;
<i>agin</i> the widda, I <i>might</i> be a-figgerin&#8217; on how t&#8217;
hitch her up t&#8217; <i>you</i>&#8211;you ole <i>woman-hater!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing <i>you</i> can do, Mister Cupid,&#8221;
growls Bergin (with a few cuss words throwed
in), &#8220;is to <i>mind-you&#8217;-own-business.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I answers cheerful. &#8220;<i>I</i> heerd y&#8217;.
But, I never could see why you fellers are so
down on me when I <i>ad</i>vise marryin&#8217;. Take my
word fer it, Sheriff, <i>any</i> man&#8217;s a heap better off
with a nice wife to look after his shack, and keep
it slicked up, and a nice baby &#8217;r two t&#8217; pull his
whiskers, and I reckon<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bergin was makin&#8217; fer the freight shed,
two-forty.</p>

<p>When I tole Mace what&#8217;d passed &#8217;twixt me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
and the sheriff, she says, &#8220;Alec, leave him alone
fer a while, and mebbe he&#8217;ll look <i>you</i> up. In love
affairs, don&#8217;t never try t&#8217; drive <i>nobody.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ain&#8217;t it funny,&#8221; I says (it was lodge
night, and we had the porch to ourselves),
&#8220;&#8211;ain&#8217;t it funny how dead set some fellers is agin
marryin&#8217;&#8211;the blamed fools! Y&#8217; see, they think
that if they <i>don&#8217;t</i> hitch up t&#8217; some sweet gal, why,
they git ahaid of somebody. It makes me plumb
sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of the lucky gal that don&#8217;t marry
such a yap,&#8221; says Mace. &#8220;If she <i>was</i> to, by
some hook &#8217;r crook, why, he&#8217;d throw it up to her
fer the balance of his life that she&#8217;d ketched him
like a rat in a trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> never could git no such notion about you,&#8221;
I says; &#8220;aw, little gal, we&#8217;ll be <i>so</i> happy, you
and me, won&#8217;t we, honey,<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, to <i>con</i>tinue with the Bridger story: You
recollect what I said about that kid needin&#8217; a
father? Wal, say! if he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; wanted one, he
shore could &#8217;a&#8217; picked from plenty of can<i>di</i>-dates.
Why, &#8217;fore long, ev&#8217;ry bach in town had
his cap set fer Mrs. Bridger&#8211;that&#8217;s <i>straight</i>.
All other subjects of <i>po</i>lite conversation was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
fergot byside the subject of the widda. Sam
Barnes was in love with her, and went &#8217;round
with that red face of hisn lookin&#8217; exac&#8217;ly like
the full moon when you see it through a sandstorm.
Chub Flannagan was in love with her,
too, and &#8217;d sit by the hour on Silverstein&#8217;s front
porch, his pop eyes shut up tight, a-rockin&#8217; hisself
back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards, back&#8217;ards and for-&#8217;ards,
and a-hummin&#8217;. Then, they was Dutchy&#8217;s
brother, August. Aw, he had it <i>bad</i>. And took
t&#8217; music, just like Chub, yas, ma&#8217;am. Why, that
feller spent <i>hours</i> a-knockin&#8217; the wind outen a&#8217;
pore accordion. And next come Frank Curry&#8211;haid over heels, too, <i>mean</i> as he was, and to
hear him talk you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; bet they wasn&#8217;t <i>nothin&#8217;</i>
he wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; done fer Mrs. Bridger. But big
talk&#8217;s cheap, and he was small potatoes, <i>you</i> bet,
and few in the hill.</p>

<p>Wal, one after the other, them four fellers
blacked they boots, wet they hair down as nice
and shiny as Hairoil&#8217;s, and went to see the widda.
She ast &#8217;em in, a-course, and was neighbourly;
fed &#8217;em, too, if it was nigh meal-time, and acted,
gen&#8217;ally speakin&#8217;, as sweet as pie.</p>

<p>But she treated &#8217;em all <i>alike</i>. And they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
knowed it. <i>Con</i>sequently, in order so&#8217;s all of &#8217;em
would git a&#8217; even chanst, and so&#8217;s they wouldn&#8217;t
be no gun-play account of one man tryin&#8217; to cut
another out by goin&#8217; to see her twicet to the
other man&#8217;s oncet, the aforesaid boys fixed up a
calendar. Sam got Monday, Curry, Wednesday,
Dutch August, Friday, and Chub, Sunday afternoons.
That tickled Chub. He owns a liv&#8217;ry-stable,
y&#8217; savvy, and ev&#8217;ry week he hitched up a
rig and took the widda and her kid fer a buggy
ride.</p>

<p>And, Bergin? Wal, I&#8217;d took Macie&#8217;s <i>ad</i>vice
and stayed away from him. But&#8211;the stay-away
plan hadn&#8217;t worked worth a darn. The sheriff, he
kept to his shack pretty steady. And one
mornin&#8217;, when I seen him at the post-office, he
didn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; t&#8217; say to nobody, and looked
sorta down on creation.</p>

<p>That fin&#8217;lly riled Mace. &#8220;What&#8217;s the <i>matter</i>
with him?&#8221; she says one day. &#8220;Why, havin&#8217;
saw the widda, how can he <i>help</i> fallin&#8217; in love
with her! She&#8217;s the <i>nicest</i> little woman! And
she&#8217;s learned me a new crochet stitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little gal,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;you&#8217; idear has been
carried out faithful&#8211;and has gone fluey. Wal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
let Cupid have a try. A-course, I was sit on
pretty hard in that confab I had with him, but,
all the same, I&#8217;ll just happen &#8217;round fer a little
neighbourly call.&#8221;</p>

<p>His shack was over behind the town cooler,
and stood by itself, kinda&#8211;a&#8217; ashes dump on one
side of it and Sparks&#8217;s hoss-corral on the other.
It had one room, just high enough so&#8217;s Bergin
wouldn&#8217;t crack his skull, and just wide enough
so&#8217;s when he laid down on his bunk he wouldn&#8217;t
kick out the side of the house. And they was a
rusty stove with a dictionary toppin&#8217; it, and a
saddle and a fryin&#8217;-pan on the bed, and a big sack
of flour a-spillin&#8217; into a pair of his boots.</p>

<p>I put the fryin&#8217;-pan on the floor, and sit down.
&#8220;Wal, Sheriff,&#8221; I begun (he had a skittle &#8217;twixt
his knees and was a-peelin&#8217; some spuds fer his dinner),
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t come t&#8217; sponge offen you. Me and
Macie Sewell had our dinner down to Mrs.
Bridger&#8217;s t&#8217;-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let slip the potato he was peelin&#8217;, and it
rolled under the stove. &#8220;Yas?&#8221; he says; &#8220;that
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>such</i> a dinner as she give us!&#8221; I goes
on. &#8220;Had a white oilcloth on the table,&#8211;white,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
with little blue vi&#8217;lets on it&#8211;and all her dishes is
white and blue. She brung &#8217;em from Buffalo.
And we had fried chicken, and corn-dodgers, and
prune somethin&#8217;-&#8217;r-other. Say! I&#8211;I s&#8217;pose <i>you</i>
ain&#8217;t been down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221;&#8211;kinda wistful, and eyes on his
peelin&#8217;&#8211;&#8220;no. How&#8211;how is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, <i>fine!</i> The kid, he ast after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; He looked up, awful tickled.
Then, &#8220;He&#8217;s a nice, little kid,&#8221; he adds thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;He <i>shore</i> is.&#8221; I riz. &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; I says, &#8220;but
I got to mosey now. Promised Mrs. Bridger I&#8217;d
take her some groceries down.&#8221; I started out,
all business. But I stopped at the door. &#8220;Reckon
I&#8217;ll have to make two trips of it&#8211;if I cain&#8217;t git
someone t&#8217; help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! it was plumb pitiful the way Bergin
grabbed at the chanst. &#8220;Why, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t mind
takin&#8217; a stroll,&#8221; he answers, gittin&#8217; some red. So
he put down the spuds and begun to curry that
cowlick of hisn.</p>

<p>First part of the way, he walked as spry as
me. But, as we come closter to the widda&#8217;s, he
got to hangin&#8217; back. And when we reached a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
big pile of sand that was out in front of the
house&#8211;he balked!</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I won&#8217;t go in,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;O. K.,&#8221; I answers. (No use to cross him, y&#8217;
savvy, it&#8217;d only &#8217;a&#8217; made him worse.)</p>

<p>When I knocked, and the widda opened the
door, she seen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how d&#8217; you do!&#8221; she called out, lookin&#8217;
mighty pleased. &#8220;Willie, dear, here&#8217;s Mister
Bergin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217; do,&#8221; says the sheriff.</p>

<p>Willie come nigh havin&#8217; a duck-fit, he was so
happy. And in about two shakes of a lamb&#8217;s
tail, he was outen the house and a-climbin&#8217; the
sheriff.</p>

<p>Inside, I says to Mrs. Bridger, &#8220;Them chickens
of yourn come, ma&#8217;am. And Hairoil Johnson&#8217;ll
drive &#8217;em down in a&#8217; hour &#8217;r so. The most
of &#8217;em looked fat and sassy, but one &#8217;r two has
got the pip.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t act like she&#8217;d heerd me. She was
watchin&#8217; the sandpile.</p>

<p>&#8220;One &#8217;r two has got the pip,&#8221; I repeats.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8211;how&#8217;s that?&#8221; she ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about you&#8217; boy,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Bergin&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
look after him. Y&#8217; know, Bergin is one
of the whitest gents in Oklahomaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> ain&#8217;t a-worryin&#8217;,&#8221; answers the widda. &#8220;<i>I</i>
know Mister Bergin is a fine man.&#8221; And she
kept on lookin&#8217; out.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this wild country,&#8221; I begun, voice &#8217;way
down to my spurs, &#8220;&#8211;this wild country, full
of rattlesnakes and Injuns and tramps, ev&#8217;ry
ranch needs a good man &#8217;round it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned like lightnin&#8217;. &#8220;What you mean?&#8221;
she ast, kinda short. (Reckon she thought <i>I</i>
was tryin&#8217; t&#8217; spark her.)</p>

<p>&#8220;A man like Bergin,&#8221; I <i>con</i>tinues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw,&#8221; she says, plumb relieved.</p>

<p>And I left things that-a-way&#8211;t&#8217; sprout.</p>

<p>Walkin&#8217; up the track afterwards, I remarked,
casual like, that they wasn&#8217;t <i>many</i> women nicer
&#8217;n Mrs. Bridger.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s <i>one</i> thing I like about her,&#8221; says the
sheriff, &#8220;&#8211;she&#8217;s got eyes like the kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Dang the kid!)</p>

<p>Wal, me and Macie and them four sparkers
wasn&#8217;t the only folks that thought the widda was
mighty nice. She&#8217;d made lots of friends at the
section-house since she come. The section-boss&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
wife said they was <i>no</i>body like her, and so did
all the greaser women at the tie-camp. She was
so handy with a needle, and allus ready to cut
out calico dingusses that the peon gals could
sew up. When they&#8217;d have one of them everlastin&#8217;
fiestas of theirn, she&#8217;d make a big cake
and a keg of lemonade, and pass it &#8217;round. And
when you <i>con</i>sider that a ten-cent package of
cigareets and a smile goes further with a Mexican
than fifty plunks and a cuss, why, you can
git some idear of how that hull outfit just <i>worshipped</i>
her.</p>

<p>Wal, they got in and done her a <i>lot</i> of good
turns. Put up a fine chicken-coop, the section-boss
overseein&#8217; the job; and, one Sunday, cleaned
out her cellar. <i>Think</i> of it! (Say! fer a man to
appreciate that, he&#8217;s got to know what lazy critters
greasers is.) Last of all, kinda to wind
things up, the cholos went out into the mesquite
and come back with a present of a nice black-and-white
Poland China hawg.</p>

<p>Wal, she <i>was</i> tickled at that, and so was the
kid. (Hairoil Johnson was shy a pig that week,
but you bet <i>he</i> never let on!) The gang made a
nice little pen, usin&#8217; ties, and ev&#8217;ry day they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
packed over some feed in the shape of the camp
leavin&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The widda was settled fine, had half a dozen
hens a-settin&#8217; and some castor beans a-growin&#8217;
in the low spots next her house, when things begun
to come to a haid with the calendar gents.
I got it straight from her that in just one solitary
week, she collected four pop-the-questions!</p>

<p>She handed out exac&#8217;ly that many pairs of
mittens&#8211;handed &#8217;em out with such a sorry look
in them kind eyes of hern, that the courtin&#8217; quartette
got worse in love with her &#8217;n ever. Anybody
could a&#8217; seen <i>that</i> with one eye. They all
begun shavin&#8217; twicet a week, most ev&#8217;ry one of
&#8217;em bought new things to wear, and&#8211;best sign
of <i>any</i>&#8211;they stopped drinkin&#8217;! Ev&#8217;ry day &#8217;r so,
back they&#8217;d track to visit the widda.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t like that fer a cent. Wasn&#8217;t nary
one of &#8217;em that suited her, and just when the
chickens &#8217;r the cholo gals needed her, here was
a Briggs City galoot a-crossin&#8217; the yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she says to Macie, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll have to
give them gents they walkin&#8217;-papers. If I don&#8217;t,
I won&#8217;t never git a lick done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully fer you!&#8221; Mace answers. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
good riddance of bad rubbish. They&#8217;re too
gally.&#8221; (Somethin&#8217; like that, anyhow.) &#8220;Learn
&#8217;em to act like they was civylised. But, say, Mrs.
Bridger, you&#8211;you ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to give the rinky-dink
to the Sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Bergin,&#8221; answers the widda, &#8220;ain&#8217;t
bothered me none.&#8221; (Mace was shore they was
tears in her eyes.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw&#8211;<i>haw!</i>&#8221; I says, when the little gal tole
me. <i>I</i> savvied.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, whilst the widda was
a-settin&#8217; on the shady side of the house, sewin&#8217;
on carpet-rags, up come Sam Barnes. (It was
Monday.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bridger,&#8221; he begun, &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to
ast you to think over what I said to you last
week. I don&#8217;t want to be haidstrong, but I&#8217;d
like to git a &#8217;yas&#8217; outen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Barnes,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m feard I
cain&#8217;t say yas. I ain&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of marryin&#8217;. But
if I was, it&#8217;d be to a man that&#8217;s&#8211;that&#8217;s big, and
tall, and has blue eyes.&#8221; And she looked out at
the sand-pile, and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; says Sam, &#8220;I reckon I don&#8217;t fit specifications.&#8221;
And he hiked fer town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>He was plumb huffy when he tole me about
it. &#8220;Fer a woman,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that&#8217;s got to look
after herself, and has a kid on her hands to
boot, she&#8217;s got more airs&#8217;n a windmill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next!</p>

<p>That was Chub.</p>

<p>Now, Chub, he knowed a heap about handlin&#8217;
a gun, and I reckon he&#8217;d pass as a liv&#8217;ry-stable
keeper, but he didn&#8217;t know much about <i>women</i>.
So, when he went down to ast the widda fer the
second time, he put his foot in it by bein&#8217; kinda
short t&#8217; little Willie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, kid,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you locate over in that
rockin&#8217;-chair yonder. Young uns of you&#8217; age
should be saw and not heerd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridger, she sit right up, and her eye-winkers
just snapped. &#8220;Mister Flannagan,&#8221; she
Says, &#8220;I&#8217;m feard you&#8217;re wastin&#8217; you&#8217; time
a-callin&#8217; here. If ever I marry again, it&#8217;s goin&#8217;
t&#8217; be a man that&#8217;s fond of childern.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, ta-ta, Chub!</p>

<p>And, behind, there was the widda at the winda,
all eyes fer that sand-pile.</p>

<p>We never knowed what she said to Dutchy&#8217;s
brother, August. But he come back to town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
lookin&#8217; madder&#8217;n a wet hen. &#8220;Huh!&#8221; he says,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t vant her <i>no</i>how. <i>She</i> couldn&#8217;t vork.
She&#8217;s pretty fer <i>nice,</i> all right, but she&#8217;s nichts
fer stoudt.&#8221;</p>

<p>When ole stingy Curry tried <i>his</i> luck over, he
took his lead from Chub&#8217;s <i>ex</i>perience. Seems he
put one arm &#8217;round the kid, and then he said no
man could kick about havin&#8217; to adopt Willie,
and he knowed that with Mrs. Bridger it was
&#8220;love me, love my dawg.&#8221; Then he tacked on
that the boy was a nice little feller, and likely
didn&#8217;t eat much.</p>

<p>&#8220;And long&#8217;s I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to marry you,&#8221;
says the widda, &#8220;why, just think&#8211;you won&#8217;t
have to feed Willie at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the next day we laughed on the other side
of our face. I went down to Mrs. Bridger&#8217;s, the
sheriff trailin&#8217;, (he balked half-way from the
sand-pile to the door, this time, and sit down on a
bucket t&#8217; play he was Willie&#8217;s steam-injine), and
I found that the little woman had been cryin&#8217;
turrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, they is. Didn&#8217;t you git a dun t&#8217;-day?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; she answers, blushin&#8217;, &#8220;I bought this
place on tick. But,&#8221; (brave as the dickens, she
was) &#8220;I&#8217;ll be able t&#8217; pay up all right&#8211;what
with my chickens and the pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>I talked with her a good bit. Then me and the
sheriff started back to town. (Had to go slow
at first; Bergin&#8217;d helt the ingineer on his knee
till his foot was asleep.) On the way, I mentioned
that dun.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Curry,</i>&#8221; says the sheriff. And he come nigh
rippin&#8217; up the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>He made fer Curry&#8217;s straight off. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the little balance due on that Starvation Gap
property?&#8221; he begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you ast?&#8221; says Curry, battin&#8217;
them sneaky little eyes of hisn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>pre</i>pared t&#8217; settle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it happens I didn&#8217;t sell to <i>you</i>. So,
a-course, I cain&#8217;t take you&#8217; money. Anyhow, I
don&#8217;t think the widda is worryin&#8217; much. She
could git shet of that balance easy.&#8221; And he
moseyed off.</p>

<p>She could git shet of it by marryin&#8217; <i>him,</i> y&#8217;
savvy&#8211;the polecat!</p>

<p>The sheriff was boilin&#8217;. &#8220;Here, Cupid,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
says, &#8220;is two hunderd. Now, we&#8217;ll go down to
Mrs. Bridger&#8217;s again, and you offer her as much
as she wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Offer it you&#8217;self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>you</i> do it, Cupid,&#8211;please. But don&#8217;t you
tell her whose money it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s where we git up The Ranchers&#8217;
Loan Fund.&#8221;</p>

<p>I coaxed Bergin as far as the front step <i>this</i>
time. Wasn&#8217;t that fine? But, say! Mrs. Bridger
wouldn&#8217;t touch a cent of that money, no
ma&#8217;am.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was to take it as a loan,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I&#8217;d
have interest to pay. So I&#8217;d be worse off &#8217;n I am
now. And I couldn&#8217;t take it in no other way.
Thank y&#8217;, just the same. And how&#8217;s Miss Sewell
t&#8217;-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t no use fer me to tell her that The
Ranchers&#8217; Loan Fund didn&#8217;t want no interest.
She was as set as Rogers&#8217;s Butte.</p>

<p>During the next week &#8217;r two, the sheriff and
me dropped down to the widda&#8217;s frequent. I&#8217;d
talk to her&#8211;about chicken-raisin&#8217; mostly&#8211;whilst
Bergin &#8217;d play with the kid. One day I
got him to come <i>as far as the door!</i> But I never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
got him no further. There he stuck, and &#8217;d stand
on the sill fer hours, lookin&#8217; out at Willie&#8211;like
a great, big, scairt, helpless calf.</p>

<p>At first the widda talked to him, pleasant and
encouragin&#8217;. But when he just said, &#8220;Yas,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and nothin&#8217; else, she
changed. I figger (&#8217;cause women is right funny)
that her pride was some hurt. What if he <i>was</i>
bound up in the boy? Didn&#8217;t he have no interest
in <i>her?</i> It hurt her all the worse, mebbe, &#8217;cause
I was there, and seen how he acted. &#8217;Fore long
she begun to git plumb outen patience with him.
And one day, when he was standin&#8217; gazin&#8217; out,
she flew up.</p>

<p>&#8220;George Bergin,&#8221; she says, &#8220;a door is somethin&#8217;
else &#8217;cept a place to scratch you back on.&#8221;
And she shut it&#8211;him outside, plumb squshed!</p>

<p>Wal, we&#8217;d did our best&#8211;both Mace and me&#8211;and
fell down. But right here is where somethin&#8217;
better&#8217;n just good luck seemed to take a-holt of
things. In the first place, <i>con</i>siderin&#8217; what come
of it, it shore was fortu<i>nate</i> that Pedro Garcia,
one of them trashy section-gang cholos, was just
a-passin&#8217; the house as she done that. He heerd
the slam. He seen the look on Bergin&#8217;s face, too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
And he fixed up what was the matter in that
crazy haid of hisn.</p>

<p>In the second place, the very <i>next</i> day, blamed
if Curry didn&#8217;t hunt Bergin up. &#8220;Sheriff,&#8221; he
begun, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t been able to collect what&#8217;s due
me from Mrs. Bridger. She ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; nothin&#8217;
with the property, neither. So I call on you to
put her off.&#8221; And he helt out a paper.</p>

<p><i>Put her off!</i> Say! You oughta saw Bergin&#8217;s
face!</p>

<p>&#8220;Curry,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in Oklahomaw, a dis-<i>po</i>ssess
notice agin a widda ain&#8217;t worth the ink it&#8217;s
drawed with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; says Curry. &#8220;You mean you
won&#8217;t act. All right. If you won&#8217;t, they&#8217;s other
folks that <i>will.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> they,&#8221; answers the sheriff, quiet. But
they was a fightin&#8217; look in his eyes. &#8220;Curry,
go slow. Don&#8217;t fergit that the Gap property ain&#8217;t
worth such a hull lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next thing, them cholos in the section-gang
&#8217;d heerd what Bergin was ordered to do.
And, like a bunch of idjits, &#8217;stead of gittin&#8217; down
on Curry, who was <i>re</i>sponsible, they begun
makin&#8217; all kinds of brags about what they&#8217;d do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
when next they seen the sheriff. And it looked
to me like gun-play was a-comin&#8217;.</p>

<p>But not just yet. Fer the reason that the
sheriff, without sayin&#8217; &#8220;I,&#8221; &#8220;Yas,&#8221; &#8217;r &#8220;No&#8221; to
nobody, all of a suddent <i>disappeared</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the dickens has struck him!&#8221; I says
t&#8217; Mace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you wait,&#8221; she answers. &#8220;It&#8217;s got t&#8217;
do with Mrs. B. He ain&#8217;t down in a cellar <i>this</i>
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, he wasn&#8217;t. But we was in the dark as
much as the rest of the town, till one evenin&#8217;
when the section-boss called me to one side. He
had somethin&#8217; t&#8217; tell me, he said. Could I keep
a secret&#8211;cross my heart t&#8217; die? Yas. Wal, then&#8211;what d&#8217; you think it was? <i>The sheriff was
camped right back of the widda&#8217;s</i>&#8211;<i>on Rogers&#8217;s
Butte!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Pardner,&#8221; I says, &#8220;don&#8217;t you cheep that to
another soul. Bergin is up there t&#8217; keep Curry
from puttin&#8217; the widda out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The section-boss begun to haw-haw. &#8220;It&#8217;d
take a hull regiment of soldiers to put the widda
out,&#8221; he says, &#8220;&#8211;with them greasers of mine so
clost.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down that way on a kinda scout,&#8221; I
says, and started off. When I got clost to the
widda&#8217;s,&#8211;about as far as from here to that
hitchin&#8217;-post yonder&#8211;I seen a crowd of women
and kids a-lookin&#8217; at somethin&#8217; behind the house.
I walked up and stretched <i>my</i> neck. And there
in that tie-pen was a&#8217; even dozen of new little
pigs!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I says, &#8220;this <i>is</i> good luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck?&#8221; repeats the widda. &#8220;I reckon
it&#8217;s somethin&#8217; more&#8217;n just good luck.&#8221; (Them&#8217;s
<i>exac&#8217;ly</i> her words&#8211;&#8220;Somethin&#8217; more&#8217;n just good
luck.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;oncet in a while, a feller&#8217;s
got to <i>ad</i>mit that somethin&#8217; better&#8217;n just or-d&#8217;nary
good luck <i>does</i> git in a whack. Mebbe
it&#8217;ll be the case of a gezaba that ain&#8217;t acted
square; first thing you know, <i>his</i> hash is settled.
Next time, it&#8217;s exac&#8217;ly the <i>other</i> way &#8217;round, and
some nice lady &#8217;r gent finds theyselves landed
not a&#8217; inch from where they wanted to be. But
neither case cain&#8217;t be called just good <i>luck, no,</i>
ma&#8217;am. Fer the reason that the contrary facts
is plumb shoved in you&#8217; face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, take what happened to Burt Slade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
Burt had a lot of potatoes ready to plant&#8211;about
six sacks of &#8217;em, I reckon. The ground was
ready, and the sacks was in the field. Wal, that
night, a blamed ornery thief come &#8217;long and stole
all them potatoes. (This was in Nebraska, mind
y&#8217;. Took &#8217;em fifty mile north and planted &#8217;em
clost to his house. So far, you might call it just
<i>bad</i> luck. <i>But</i>&#8211;a wind come up, a <i>turrible</i> wind,
and blowed all the dirt offen them potatoes;
next, it lifted &#8217;em and sent &#8217;em a-kitin&#8217; through
the windas of that thief&#8217;s house&#8211;yas, ma&#8217;am, it
took &#8217;em in at the one side, and outen the other,
breakin&#8217; ev&#8217;ry blamed pane of glass; then&#8211;I&#8217;m
another if it ain&#8217;t so!&#8211;it sailed &#8217;em all that fifty
mile back to Slade&#8217;s and druv &#8217;em into the ground
that he&#8217;d fixed fer &#8217;em. And when they sprouted,
a little bit later on that spring, Slade seen <i>they&#8217;d
been planted in rows!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t no doubt about this story bein&#8217;
<i>true</i>. In the first place, Slade ain&#8217;t a man that&#8217;d
lie; in the second place, ev&#8217;rybody knows his
potatoes was <i>stole,</i> and ev&#8217;rybody knows that,
just the same, he had a powerful big crop that
year; and, then, Slade can show you his field
any time you happen to be in that part of Nebraska.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
And no man wants any better proof&#8217;n
<i>that.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A-<i>course,</i> he don&#8217;t,&#8221; says the widda. &#8220;And
I&#8217;d call that potato transaction plumb wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shore was.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned back to the hawgs. &#8220;I can almost
see these little pigs grow,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
right fond of &#8217;em a&#8217;ready. I&#8211;I hope nothin&#8217;
bad&#8217;ll happen to &#8217;em. I&#8217;m a little nervous,
though. &#8217;Cause&#8211;have you noticed, Mister
Lloyd?&#8211;<i>they&#8217;s just thirteen pigs in that pen.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, thirteen ain&#8217;t never hurt nobody in Oklahomaw,&#8221;
I says. And I whistled, and knocked
on wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;m happy,&#8221; she goes on, &#8220;I&#8217;m
better fixed than I been fer a coon&#8217;s age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The eatin&#8217;-house &#8217;ll buy ev&#8217;ry one of these
pigs at a good price,&#8221; I says, leanin&#8217; on the pen
till I was well nigh broke in two, &#8220;they bein&#8217;
pen-fed, and not just <i>common</i> razor-backs.
That&#8217;ll mean fifty dollars&#8211;mebbe more. Why,
it&#8217;s like <i>findin&#8217;</i> it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These and the chickens,&#8221; she says, &#8220;&#8217;ll pay
that balance, and&#8221; (her voice broke, kinda,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
and she looked over to where pore little Willie
was tryin&#8217; to play injine all by hisself) &#8220;without
the help of <i>no</i> man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up at the Butte. Was that black
speck the sheriff? And wasn&#8217;t his heart a-bustin&#8217;
fer her? Wal, it shore was a fool sittywaytion!</p>

<p>&#8220;The section-hands is turrible tickled about
these pigs,&#8221; <i>con</i>tinues Mrs. Bridger. &#8220;They
come over this mornin&#8217; t&#8217; see how the fambly
was doin&#8217;, and they named the hull litter, beginnin&#8217;
with Carmelita, and ending&#8217; with Polky
Dot.&#8221;</p>

<p>You couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; blamed <i>no</i>body fer bein&#8217;
proud of them little pigs. They was smarter &#8217;n
the dickens, playin&#8217; &#8217;round, and kickin&#8217; up they
heels, and <i>squee-ee-eelin&#8217;</i>. All black and white
they was, too, and favoured they maw strong.
Ev&#8217;ry blamed one had a pink snoot and a kink
in its tail, and reg&#8217;lar rolly buckshot eyes. And
fat!&#8211;say, no josh, them little pigs was so fat
they had double chins&#8211;just one chin right after
another&#8211;from they noses plumb back to they
hind laigs!</p>

<p>But you never can gamble on t&#8217;-morra. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
the widda, countin&#8217; as she did on them pigs, had
to find that out. A-course, if she&#8217;d been a&#8217; Irish
lady, she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; just natu&#8217;lly <i>took</i> to ownin&#8217; a
bunch of hawgs, and she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; likely penned &#8217;em
closter to the house. Then nothin&#8217; would &#8217;a&#8217; hurt
&#8217;em. Again, mebbe it <i>would</i>&#8211;if the hull thing
that happened next was accidentally a-purpose.
And I reckon that shore was the truth of it.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; too fast.</p>

<p>It was the mornin&#8217; after the Fourth of July.
(That was why I was in town.) I was in the
Arnaz bunk-house, pullin&#8217; on my coat, just afore
daylight, when, all of a suddent, right over
Rogers&#8217;s Butte, somethin&#8217; popped. Here, acrosst
the sky, went a red ball, big, and as bright as if
it was on fire. As it come into sight, it had a
tail of light a-hangin&#8217; to it. It dropped at the
foot of the butte.</p>

<p>First off, I says, &#8220;More celebratin&#8217;.&#8221; Next,
I says, &#8220;Curry!&#8221;&#8211;and streaked it fer the
widda&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8217;Fore I was half-way, I heerd hollerin&#8217;&#8211;the
scairt hollerin&#8217; of women and kids. Then I
heerd the grumble of men&#8217;s voices. I yelled myself,
hopin&#8217; some of the boys &#8217;d hear me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
foller. &#8220;Help! help!&#8221; I let out at the top of
my lungs, and brung up in Mrs. Bridger&#8217;s yard.</p>

<p>It was just comin&#8217; day, and I could see that
section-gang all collected t&#8217;gether, some with
picks, and the rest with heavy track tools. All
the greaser women was there, too, howlin&#8217; like a
pack of coy<i>o</i>tes. Whilst Mrs. Bridger had the
kid in her arms, and her face hid in his little
dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I screeched&#8211;<i>had</i> t&#8217;
screech t&#8217; git <i>heerd</i>.</p>

<p>The cholos turned towards me. (Say! You
talk about mean faces!) &#8220;Diablo!&#8221; they says,
shakin&#8217; them track tools.</p>

<p>Wal, it shore looked like the Ole Harry &#8217;d
done it! &#8217;Cause right where the pig-pen used to
was, I could see the top of a grea-a-at, whoppin&#8217;
rock, half in and half outen the ground, and
<i>smokin&#8217; hot</i>. Pretty nigh as big as a box-car, it
was. Wal, as big as a wagon, <i>any</i>how. But
neither hide &#8217;r hair of them pigs!</p>

<p>I walked &#8217;round that stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; I says to the section-boss, &#8220;the
maw-pig made just thirteen. It&#8217;s a proposition
you cain&#8217;t beat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>Them cholos was all quiet now, and actin&#8217; as
keerful as if that rock was dynamite. Queer and
shivery, they was, about it, and it kinda give me
the creeps.</p>

<p>Next, they begun pointin&#8217; up to the top of the
Butte!</p>

<p>I seen what was comin&#8217;. So I used my haid&#8211;quick,
so&#8217;s to stave off trouble. &#8220;Mebbe, boys,&#8221;
I says, lookin&#8217; the ground over some more,
&#8220;&#8211;mebbe they was a cyclone last night to the
north of here, and this blowed in from Kansas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The section-boss walked &#8217;round, studyin&#8217;. &#8220;I&#8217;m
from Missoura,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and it strikes <i>me</i> that
this rock looks kinda familiar, like it was part
iron. Now, mebbe they&#8217;s been a thunderin&#8217; big
<i>ex</i>plosion in the Ozark Mountains. But, Mrs.
Bridger, as a native son of the ole State, I don&#8217;t
want to <i>ad</i>vise you to sue fer da<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I heerd them cholos smackin&#8217; they lips. I
looked where they was lookin&#8217;, and here, a-comin&#8217;
lickety-split, was the sheriff!</p>

<p>That section-boss was as good-natured a feller
as ever lived, and never liked t&#8217; think bad
of <i>no</i> man. But the minute he seen Bergin racin&#8217;
down offen that Butte, he believed like the peons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
did. He turned t&#8217; me. &#8220;By George!&#8221; he says&#8211;just like that.</p>

<p>Wal, sir, that &#8220;By George&#8221; done it. Soon as
the Mexicans heerd him speak out what <i>they</i>
thought, they set up a Comanche yell, and, with
the whites of they eyes showin&#8217; like a nigger&#8217;s,
they made towards the sheriff on the dead run.</p>

<p>He kept a-comin&#8217;. Most men, seein&#8217; a passel
of locoed greasers makin&#8217; towards &#8217;em with pickaxes,
would &#8217;a&#8217; turned and run, figgerin&#8217; that
leg-bail was good enough fer <i>them</i>. But the
sheriff, he wasn&#8217;t scairt.</p>

<p>A second, and the Mexicans &#8217;d made a surround.
He pulled his gun. They jerked it outen
his hand. He throwed &#8217;em off.</p>

<p>I drawed <i>my</i> weapon.</p>

<p>Just then&#8211;&#8220;Sheriff! sheriff!&#8221; (It was the
widda, one hand helt out towards him.)</p>

<p>A great idear come to me then. I put my best
friend back into my pocket. &#8220;I won&#8217;t interfere
fer a while yet,&#8221; I says to myself. &#8220;Mebbe this
is where they&#8217;ll be a show-down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; says Bergin, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>I fit my way to him. &#8220;They think you throwed
this rock, here,&#8221; I answers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>&#8220;The low-down, ornery, lay-in-the-sun-and-snooze
good-fer-nothin&#8217;s is likely t&#8217; think &#8217;most
<i>any</i> ole thing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Pedro, let go my arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, one of the cholos come runnin&#8217; up
with a rope!</p>

<p>The section-boss seen things was gittin&#8217; pretty
serious. He begun to wrastle with the feller that
had the rope. Next, all the women and kids set
up another howlin&#8217;, Mrs. Bridger cryin&#8217; the
worst. But I wasn&#8217;t ready to play my last card.
I stepped out in front of the gang and helt up
my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; I says; &#8220;<i>boys! Give</i> the man a chanst
t&#8217; talk. Why, this rock ain&#8217;t like the rocks on the
Butte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You blamed idjits!&#8221; yells Bergin. &#8220;Use you&#8217;
haids! How could <i>I</i> &#8217;a&#8217; hefted the darned
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, he <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> &#8217;a&#8217; done it!&#8221; (This from the
widda, mind y&#8217;,&#8211;hands t&#8217;gether, and comin&#8217;
clost.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217;, little woman,&#8221; says the sheriff.</p>

<p>(Say! that was <i>better</i>.)</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/illus-128.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;<i>He pulled his gun, they jerked it outen his hand</i>&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>But the cholos wasn&#8217;t a-foolin&#8217;&#8211;they was in
dead earnest. Next minute, part of &#8217;em grabbed
Bergin, got that rope &#8217;round him, and begun
draggin&#8217; him towards a telegraph pole.</p>

<p>I was some anxious, but I knowed enough to
hole back a while more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, boys,&#8221; begged the widda, droppin&#8217;
Willie and runnin&#8217; &#8217;longside, &#8220;don&#8217;t hurt him!
<i>don&#8217;t!</i> What does the pigs matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll discharge ev&#8217;ry one of you,&#8221; says the
section-boss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; I begun again, &#8220;<i>why</i> should this
gent want to harm this lady. Why, I can tell
you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Pedro Garcia stuck his black fist into my face.
&#8220;He lof her,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and she say no. So he
iss revenge hisself.&#8221; (Say! the grammar they
use is plumb fierce.)</p>

<p>&#8220;He iss revenge hisself!&#8221; yells the rest of the
bunch. Then they all looked at the widda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; she sobs, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t <i>never</i> refused him.
Fer a good reason&#8211;he ain&#8217;t never ast me.&#8221;</p>

<p>(The cholos, they just growled.)</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; I ast, turnin&#8217; on Bergin like I was
hoppin&#8217;. &#8220;You love her, and yet you ain&#8217;t never
ast her to marry you? Wal, you blamed bottle
of ketchup, you <i>oughta</i> die!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;How <i>could</i> I ast her?&#8221; begun the sheriff.
&#8220;She plumb hates the sight of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t! I don&#8217;t!&#8221; sobs the widda. &#8220;Mister
Lloyd knows that ain&#8217;t so. Willie and me, we&#8211;we<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8217; <i>see?</i>&#8221; I turned to the Mexicans. &#8220;He
loves her; she loves him. We&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to have a
weddin&#8217;, not a hangin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stone&#8211;he iss revenge,&#8221; says Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;The stone,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;come outen the sky.
It&#8217;s a mete&#8217;rite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt it hit!&#8221; cries the widda.</p>

<p>Wal, you couldn&#8217;t expect a Mexican t&#8217; swaller
<i>that</i>. So we&#8217;d no more&#8217;n got the words outen our
mouths when they begun to dance &#8217;round Bergin
again with the halter.</p>

<p>Wal, how do you think it come out?</p>

<p>Mebbe you figger that Mrs. Bridger drawed
a knife and sa-a-aved him, &#8217;r I pulled my gun
and stood there, tellin&#8217; &#8217;em they &#8217;d only hang the
sheriff over my dead body. But that ain&#8217;t the
way it happened. No, ma&#8217;am. <i>This</i> is how:</p>

<p>&#8217;Round the bend from towards Albuquerque
come the pay-car. Now, the pay-car, she stops
just one minute fer ev&#8217;ry section-hand, and them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
section-hands was compelled to git into line and
be quick about it, &#8217;r not git they money. So they
didn&#8217;t have no spare time. They let go of Bergin&#8217;s
rope and run&#8211;the section-boss leadin&#8217;.</p>

<p>The sheriff, he slung the rope to one side&#8211;and
the widda goes into his arms. &#8220;Little woman,&#8221; he
says, lookin&#8217; down at her, &#8220;I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll be a good
father to the boy.&#8221; Then he kissed her.</p>

<p>(Wal, that&#8217;s about all you could reas&#8217;nably expect
from <i>Bergin</i>.)</p>

<p>Next thing, he borraed my gun and just kinda
happened over towards the pay-car. And when
a cholo got his time and left the line, he showed
him the way he was to go. And you bet he
<i>minded!</i></p>

<p>Wal, things come out <i>fine</i>. A big museum in
Noo York bought that rock (If you don&#8217;t believe
it, just go to that museum and you&#8217;ll see
it a-settin&#8217; out in front&#8211;big as life.) A-course,
Mrs. Bridger got a nice little pile of money fer
it, and paid Curry the balance she owed him.
Then, the sheriff got Mrs. Bridger!</p>

<p>And the bunch that didn&#8217;t git her? Wal, the
bunch that didn&#8217;t git her just natu&#8217;lly got <i>left!</i></p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER FIVE<br /><span class='h2fs'>THINGS GIT STARTED WRONG</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Up</span> to the day of the sheriff&#8217;s weddin&#8217;, I reckon I
was about the happiest feller that&#8217;s ever been in
these parts. Gee! but I was in high spirits! It&#8217;d
be Macie&#8217;s and my turn next, I figgered, and if
the ole man didn&#8217;t like it, he could just natu&#8217;lly
lump it. So when I walked through Briggs, why,
I hit both sides of the street, exac&#8217;ly as if I was
three sheets in the wind.</p>

<p>But&#8211;this was one time when you&#8217; friend
Cupid was just a little bit too previous. And I
want to say right here that <i>no</i> feller needs to
think he&#8217;s the hull shootin&#8217;-match with a gal, and
has the right-a-way, like a wild-cat ingine on a&#8217;
open track, just &#8217;cause she&#8217;s ast him to write in
her autograph-album. It don&#8217;t mean such a
blamed lot, neither, if his picture is stuck &#8217;longside
of hern on top of the organ. Them signs
is encouragin&#8217;, a-course; but he&#8217;d best take his
coat off and <i>git to work</i>. Even when she&#8217;s give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
all the others the G. B., and has gone to church
with him about forty Sunday evenin&#8217;s, hand
runnin&#8217;, and has allus saved him the grand march
and the last waltz at the Fireman&#8217;s Ball, and
mebbe six &#8217;r seven others bysides, why, even <i>then</i>
it&#8217;s a toss-up. Yas, ma&#8217;am. It took hard knocks
t&#8217; learn me that they&#8217;s nothin&#8217; dead certain short
of the parson&#8217;s &#8220;amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Y&#8217; see, you can plug a&#8217; Injun, and kick a
dawg, and take a club to a mule; but when it&#8217;s
a gal, and a feller thinks a turrible lot of her,
and she&#8217;s so all-fired skittish he cain&#8217;t manage
her, and so eludin&#8217; he cain&#8217;t find her no two times
in the same place, <i>what&#8217;s he goin&#8217; to do?</i> Wal,
they ain&#8217;t no reg&#8217;lar way of proceedin&#8217;&#8211;ev&#8217;ry
man has got to blaze his own trail.</p>

<p>But I couldn&#8217;t, and that was the hull trouble.
I know now that when it come to dealin&#8217; with
Mace, I shore was a darned softy. That little
Muggins could twist me right &#8217;round her finger&#8211;and me not know it! One minute, she&#8217;d pallaver
me fer further orders, whilst I&#8217;d look into
them sweet eyes of hern till I was plumb dizzy;
the next, she&#8217;d be cuttin&#8217; up some dido &#8217;r other
and leadin&#8217; me a&#8217; awful chase.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>Then, mebbe, I&#8217;d git sore at her, and think
mighty serious about shakin&#8217; the Bar Y dust
offen my boots fer good. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; I&#8217;d say to
myself, &#8220;git you&#8217; duds t&#8217;gether, and do you&#8217;
blankets up in you&#8217; poncho.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just about then, here she come lopin&#8217; home
from town, her hoss cuttin&#8217; up like Sam Hill,
and her a-settin&#8217; so straight and cute. She&#8217;d look
towards the bunk-house, see me, motion me over
with her quirt, and&#8211;wal, a-course, I&#8217;d go.</p>

<p>I made my <i>first</i> big beefsteak at the very beginnin&#8217;.
Somehow &#8217;r other, right from the minute
we had our confidential talk t&#8217;gether back of Silverstein&#8217;s,
that last night of the Medicine Show.
I got it into my fool haid that I as good as had
her, and that all they was left to be did was t&#8217; git
&#8217;round the ole man. Wal, this idear worked fine
as long as we was so busy with Bergin&#8217;s courtin&#8217;.
But when the sheriff was hitched, and me and the
little gal got a recess, my! <i>my!</i> but a heap of
things begun t&#8217; happen!</p>

<p>They started off like this: The parson wanted
money fer t&#8217; buy some hymn-books with. So he
planned a&#8217; ice-cream social and entertainment,
and ast Mace to go down on the pro<i>gram</i> fer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
a song. She was willin&#8217;; I was, <i>too</i>. So far, ev&#8217;ry-thin&#8217;
smooth as glare-ice.</p>

<p>But fer a week afore that social, they was a
turrible smell of gasoline outside the sittin&#8217;-room
of the Bar Y ranch-house. That&#8217;s &#8217;cause Doctor
Bugs come out ev&#8217;ry day&#8211;to fetch a Goldstone
woman from the up-train. (That blamed sulky
of hisn &#8217;d been stuck t&#8217;gether with flour paste by
now, y&#8217; savvy, and was in apple-pie order.)
After the woman &#8217;d git to the ranch-house, why,
the organ &#8217;d strike up. Then you could hear
Macie&#8217;s voice&#8211;doin&#8217;, &#8220;<i>do, ray, me.</i>&#8221; Next, she&#8217;d
break loose a-singin&#8217;. And pretty soon the doc
and the woman &#8217;d go.</p>

<p>Wal, I didn&#8217;t like it. Y&#8217; see, I&#8217;ve allus noticed
that if a city feller puts hisself out fer you a hull
lot, he expects you t&#8217; give him a drink, &#8217;r vote
fer him, &#8217;r loan him some money. And why was
Bugsey botherin&#8217; t&#8217; make so many trips to the
Bar Y? <i>I</i> knowed what it was. It was just like
Hairoil &#8217;d said&#8211;he wanted my Macie.</p>

<p>One night, I says to her, &#8220;What&#8217;s that Goldstone
woman doin&#8217; out here so much, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Givin&#8217; me music lessons,&#8221; she answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I says. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t need no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
lessons. You sing good enough t&#8217; suit me right
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I don&#8217;t sing good enough t&#8217; suit myself.
And bein&#8217; as I&#8217;m on that pro<i>gram</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, just the same,&#8221; I cut in, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
that Simpson hangin&#8217; &#8217;round here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she come back, stiffenin&#8217; right up,
&#8220;it&#8217;s my place to say who comes into this ranch-house,
and who don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, look a-here! Folks &#8217;ll think you like
him better&#8217;n you do me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, that&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t. And I won&#8217;t have him &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, she got <i>turrible po</i>lite. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,
Mister Lloyd,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; take
my lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, the long and short of it is, she did&#8211;right
up t&#8217; the very day of the social.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I says to myself; &#8220;but just wait
till this shindig is over.&#8221; And when Mace and
her paw started fer town that evenin&#8217;, I saddled
up my bronc and follered &#8217;em.</p>

<p>Simpson was kinda in charge of that social.
He got up and made a&#8217; openin&#8217; speech, sayin&#8217;
they was lots of ice-cream and cake fer sale, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
he hoped we&#8217;d all shell out good. Then, he begun
t&#8217; read off the pro<i>gram</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have with us t&#8217;night,&#8221; he says, &#8220;one of
the finest and best trained voices in this hull
United States&#8211;a voice that I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if it &#8217;d be celebrated some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked over at Mace. She was gittin&#8217; pink.
Did he mean her?</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; Simpson goes on, &#8220;the young lady
that owns it is a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; give us the first number.&#8221;
And he bowed&#8211;Shore enough!</p>

<p>Wal, she sung. It was somethin&#8217; about poppies,
and it was awful sad, and had love in it.
I liked it pretty nigh as good as The Mohawk
Vale. But the ole man, he didn&#8217;t. And when she
was done, and settin&#8217; next him again, he said out
loud, so&#8217;s a lot of people heerd him, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
stuck on havin&#8217; you singin&#8217; &#8217;round &#8217;fore ev&#8217;ry-body.
And that Noo York Doc is too blamed
fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paw!&#8221; she says, like she was ashamed of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>mean</i> it,&#8221; he says, and jerked his haid to
one side.</p>

<p>Wal, y&#8217; know, Mace got her temper offen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
him, and never handed it back. So all durin&#8217; the
social, they had it&#8211;up and down. I couldn&#8217;t
ketch all what they said&#8211;only little bits, now and
then. &#8220;Cheek,&#8221; I heard the boss say oncet, and
Mace come back with somethin&#8217; about not bein&#8217;
&#8220;a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Afterwards, when the ole man was out gittin&#8217;
the team, she come over t&#8217; me, lookin&#8217; awful appealin&#8217;.
&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says, like she expected I&#8217;d
shore sympathise with her, &#8220;did you hear what
paw said? Wasn&#8217;t it mean of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked down at my boots. Then, I looked
straight at her. &#8220;Mace,&#8221; I says, &#8220;he&#8217;s right.
Mebbe you&#8217;ll git mad at me, too, fer sayin&#8217; it.
But that Simpson&#8217;s tryin&#8217; t&#8217; cut me out&#8211;and
so he&#8217;s givin&#8217; you all this taffy about your voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taffy!&#8221; she says, fallin&#8217; back a step.
&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t <i>like my singin&#8217;.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yas, I did,&#8221; I answers, follerin&#8217; along
after her. &#8220;I thought it was <i>fine.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>But she only shook her haid&#8211;like she was hurt&#8211;and clumb into the buckboard.</p>

<p>I worried a good deal that night. The more I
turned over what Simpson &#8217;d said, the more I
wondered if I knowed all they was to his game.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
What was he drivin&#8217; at with that &#8220;celebrated&#8221;
business? Then, too, it wouldn&#8217;t do Mace no
good t&#8217; be puffed up so much. She&#8217;d been &#8217;lected
the prettiest gal. Now she&#8217;d been tole she had
a way-up voice. &#8217;Fore long, she&#8217;d git the big
haid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll put a qui<i>e</i>tus on it,&#8221; I says. And,
next mornin&#8217;, when I seen her, I opened up like
this: &#8220;Honey, I reckon we&#8217;ve waited just about
long enough. So we git married Sunday week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too soon,&#8221; she answers. &#8220;We got t&#8217;
git paw on our side. And I ain&#8217;t got no new
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll splice first and ast him about it afterwards.
And when you&#8217;re Mrs. Alec, I&#8217;ll git you
all the clothes you want.&#8221; (Here&#8217;s where I clean
fergot the <i>ad</i>vice she give me that time in the
sheriff&#8217;s case: &#8220;In love affairs,&#8221; was what she
said, &#8220;don&#8217;t never try t&#8217; drive <i>no</i>body.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Alec,<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; she begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday week, Mace,&#8221; I says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk
about it t&#8217;-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that night Monkey Mike come nigh blowin&#8217;
his lungs out; and I waited under the cottonwoods
till I was asleep standin&#8217;&#8211;and no Macie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>Wasn&#8217;t it cal&#8217;lated t&#8217; make any man lose his
temper? Wal, I lost mine. And when we went
in town to a party, a night &#8217;r two afterwards, the
hull business come to a haid.</p>

<p>I was plumb sorry about the blamed mix-up.
But <i>no</i> feller wants t&#8217; see his gal dance with a
kettle-faced greaser. I knowed she was goin&#8217;
to fer the reason that I seen Mexic go over her
way, showin&#8217; his teeth like a badger and lettin&#8217;
his cigareet singe the hair on his dirty shaps&#8211;shaps,
mind y&#8217;, at a school-house dance! Then I
seen her nod.</p>

<p>Our polka come next. And when we was about
half done, I says, &#8220;They&#8217;s lemonade outside,
honey. Let&#8217;s git a swig.&#8221; But outside I didn&#8217;t
talk no lemonade. &#8220;Did Mexic ast you to dance
with him?&#8221; I begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, he&#8217;s one of our boys,&#8221; she answers;
&#8220;and I&#8217;m going to give him a schottische.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you <i>ain&#8217;t,</i>&#8221; I come back. &#8220;I won&#8217;t stand
fer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, I <i>am,</i> Alec Lloyd,&#8221;&#8211;she spoke determined,&#8211;&#8220;and
please don&#8217;t try to boss me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shut up and walked in again. Mexic was
talkin&#8217; to the school-ma&#8217;am&#8211;aw, he&#8217;s got <i>gall!</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
I shassayed up and took him a little one side.
&#8220;Mexic,&#8221; I says, soft as hair on a cotton-tail,
&#8220;it&#8217;s gittin&#8217; on towards mornin&#8217; and, natu&#8217;lly,
Macie Sewell ain&#8217;t feelin&#8217; just rested; so I wouldn&#8217;t
insist on that schottische, if I was you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tole you why,&#8221; I says; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll give you
another reason: You&#8217; boots is too tight.&#8221;</p>

<p>We fussed a little then. Didn&#8217;t amount to
much, though, &#8217;cause neither of us had a gun.
(Y&#8217; see, us punchers don&#8217;t pack guns no more
&#8217;less we&#8217;re out ridin&#8217; herd and want t&#8217; pick off a
coy<i>o</i>te; &#8217;r &#8217;less we&#8217;ve had a little trouble and &#8217;re
lookin&#8217; fer some one.) But I managed to change
that greaser&#8217;s countenance consider&#8217;ble, and he
bit a chunk outen my hand. Then the boys pulled
us separate.</p>

<p>They was all dead agin me when I tole &#8217;em
what was the matter. They said the other gals
danced with Mexic, and bein&#8217; Macie was the Bar
Y gal, she couldn&#8217;t give him the go-by if she
took the rest of the outfit fer pardners.</p>

<p>Just the same, I made up my mind she wouldn&#8217;t
dance with that <i>greaser</i>. And I says to myself,
&#8220;This is where you show you&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
run the Lloyd house. She&#8217;ll like you all the better
if you git the upper hand.&#8221; So when I got
her coaxed outside again, I led her to where my
bronc was tied. She liked the little hoss, and
whilst we was chinnin&#8217;, I put her into the saddle.
Next minute, I was on behind her, and the bronc
was makin&#8217; quick tracks fer home.</p>

<p>Wal, sir, she was madder&#8217;n a hen in a thunder-shower.
She tried to pull in the bronc; she
twisted and scolted and cried. Tole me she hated
me like arsenic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec Lloyd,&#8221; she says, &#8220;after t&#8217;night, I&#8217;ll
never, never speak to you again!&#8221;</p>

<p>When we rode up to the corral, I lifted her
down, and she went tearin&#8217; away to the house.
The ole man heerd her comin&#8217;, and thought she
was singin&#8217;. He slung open the door on the
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, give that calf more rope!&#8221; he calls out.</p>

<p>Say! she went by him like a streak of lightnin&#8217;,
almost knockin&#8217; him down. And the door
slammed so hard you could &#8217;a&#8217; heerd it plumb t&#8217;
Galveston.</p>

<p>I hung &#8217;round the corral fer as much as half
a&#8217; hour, listenin&#8217; to the pow-wow goin&#8217; on at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
house. But nobody seemed to be a-hollerin&#8217; fer
me t&#8217; come in, so I made fer the straw. &#8220;Aw,
wal,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;her dander &#8217;ll cool off
t&#8217;-morra.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the next day, she passed me by without
speakin&#8217;. And I, like a sap-head, didn&#8217;t speak
neither. I was on my high hoss,&#8211;wouldn&#8217;t speak
till <i>she</i> did. So off I had t&#8217; go to Hasty Creek
fer three days&#8211;and no good-bye t&#8217; the little
gal.</p>

<p>I got back late one afternoon. At the bunk-house,
I noticed a change in the boys. They all
seemed just about t&#8217; bust over somethin&#8217;&#8211;not
laughin&#8217;, y&#8217; savvy, but anxious, kinda, and achin&#8217;
to tell news.</p>

<p>Fin&#8217;lly, I went over to Hairoil. &#8220;Pardner,&#8221; I
says, &#8220;spit it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says, &#8220;us fellers
don&#8217;t like t&#8217; git you stirred up, but we think it&#8217;s
about time someone oughta speak&#8211;and put you
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next about what?&#8221; I ast. The way he said
it give me a kinda start.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve saw how things was a-goin&#8217;, but we
didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217; to you &#8217;cause it wasn&#8217;t none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
of our funeral. Quite a spell back, folks begun
to talk about how crazy Macie Sewell was gittin&#8217;
to be on the singin&#8217; question. It leaked out that
she&#8217;d been tole she had a A1 voice<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no lie, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that her warblin&#8217; come pretty clost to
bein&#8217; as good as Melba&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a heap <i>better&#8217;n</i> Melba&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also&#8221;&#8211;Hairoil fidgited some&#8211;&#8220;you know,
a-course, that she&#8217;s been tackin&#8217; up photographs
of op&#8217;ra singers and actresses in her room<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, what&#8217;s the harm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8211;and practicin&#8217; bows in front of a
glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>I begun t&#8217; see what he was drivin&#8217; at.</p>

<p>&#8220;And whilst you was away, she had a talk
with the station-agent&#8211;about rates East.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hairoil! You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; I says. I tell
y&#8217;, it was just like a red-hot iron &#8217;d been stuck
down my wind-pipe and was a-burnin&#8217; the lower
end offen my breast-bone!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ole man.&#8221; He reached out a hand.
&#8220;But we thought you oughta know.&#8221; And then
he left me.</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was it! And she&#8217;d been keepin&#8217; me in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
the dark about it all&#8211;whilst ev&#8217;ry fence post
from the Bar Y t&#8217; Briggs knowed what was happenin&#8217;!
Wal, I was mad clean <i>through</i>.</p>

<p>Then I begun t&#8217; see that I&#8217;d been a blamed
fool. A fine, high-strung gal!&#8211;and I&#8217;d been
orderin&#8217; her &#8217;round like I owned her! And I&#8217;d
gone away on that ride without tryin&#8217; t&#8217; make up.
Wal, I&#8217;d <i>druv</i> her to it.</p>

<p>I started fer the house.</p>

<p>As I come clost, acrosst the curtains, back&#8217;ards
and for&#8217;ards, back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards, I could see
her shadda pass. But when I rapped, she pulled
up; then, she opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honey,&#8221; I says, &#8220;can I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes was red; she&#8217;d been cryin&#8217;. But, aw!
she was just as nice and sweet as she could be.
&#8220;Yas, Alec, come in,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little gal,&#8221; I begun, &#8220;I want t&#8217; tell you I
done wrong to kick about that greaser, yas, I
did. And fetchin&#8217; you home that-a-way wasn&#8217;t
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind&#8211;I wanted t&#8217; come anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217; fer bein&#8217; so kind. And I ain&#8217;t
never goin&#8217; to try to run you no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that No gal likes t&#8217; be bossed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;Just give me another chanst. Just fergive
me this oncet.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, her eyes shinin&#8217; with tears. &#8220;I
do,&#8221; she says; &#8220;Alec, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next second, I had her helt clost in my
arms, and her pretty haid was agin my breast.
Aw, it was like them first days once more. And
all the hurt went of a suddent, and the air cleared
kinda&#8211;as if a storm&#8217;d just passed. My little
gal!</p>

<p>Pretty soon, (I was settin&#8217; on the organ-stool,
and she was standin&#8217; in front of me, me holdin&#8217;
her hands) I says, &#8220;They <i>is</i> one thing&#8211;now that
I&#8217;ve tole you I was wrong&#8211;they is <i>just</i> one
thing I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ast you t&#8217; do as a favour. If
you do it, things &#8217;ll go smooth with us from now
on. It&#8217;s this, little gal: Cut out that Doctor
Bugs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you don&#8217;t like him,&#8221; she answers;
&#8220;and you&#8217;re right. &#8217;Cause he shore played
you a low-down trick at that Medicine Show.
But, Alec, he brings my music-teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, honey, what you <i>want</i> the teacher fer?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, and up went that pert, little haid.
&#8220;You recollect what Doctor Simpson said about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
my voice that night at the social?&#8221; she begun.
&#8220;This teacher says <i>the same thing.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a flash, I <i>re</i>called what <i>Hairoil</i> &#8217;d tole me.
&#8220;Mace,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I want t&#8217; ast you about that.
A-course, I know it ain&#8217;t so. But Hairoil says
you got pictures of actresses and singers tacked
up in you&#8217; room&#8211;just one &#8217;r two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; she answers; &#8220;that&#8217;s straight. What
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, I guess. But the ole son-of-a-gun
got the idear, kinda, that you was thinkin&#8217;
some of&#8211;of the East.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says, frank as could be, &#8220;yesterday
Doctor Simpson got a letter from Noo York.
He&#8217;d writ a big teacher there, inquirin&#8217; if I had
a chanst t&#8217; git into op&#8217;ra&#8211;<i>grand</i> op&#8217;ra&#8211;and the
teacher says yas.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t answer nothin&#8217;. I just sit there,
knocked plumb silly, almost, and looked at a big
rose in the carpet. <i>Noo York!</i></p>

<p>She brung her hands t&#8217;gether. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
she answers. &#8220;It&#8217;ll give me the chanst I want.
If I&#8217;m a success, you could come on too, Alec.
Then we&#8217;d marry, and you could go along with
me as my manager.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>I looked at her. I was hurt&#8211;hurt plumb t&#8217; the
quick, and a little mad, too. &#8220;I <i>see</i> myself!&#8221; I
says. &#8220;Travel along with you&#8217; poodle. Huh!
And you wearin&#8217; circus clothes like that Miss
Marvellous Murray, and lettin&#8217; some feller kiss
you in the play. Macie,&#8221;&#8211;and I meant what I
said&#8211;&#8220;you can just put the hull thing right to
one side. I&#8211;won&#8217;t&#8211;<i>have</i>&#8211;it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She set her lips tight, and her face got a deep
red.</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>this</i> is the way you keep you&#8217; word!&#8221;
she says. &#8220;A minute ago, you said you wasn&#8217;t
goin&#8217; t&#8217; try to run me no more. Wal,&#8211;you wasn&#8217;t
in earnest. I can see that. &#8217;Cause here&#8217;s the same
thing over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door into the ole man&#8217;s bedroom opened
then, and he come walkin&#8217; out. &#8220;You two make
a thunderin&#8217; lot of noise,&#8221; he begun. &#8220;What in
the dickens is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mace turned to him, face still a-blazin&#8217;.
&#8220;Alec&#8217;s allus tryin&#8217; t&#8217; run me,&#8221; she answers,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; plumb tired of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sewell&#8217;s mouth come open. &#8220;Run you,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;Wal, some while back he done all the
runnin&#8217; he&#8217;s ever a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; do in <i>this</i> house. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
he don&#8217;t do no more of it. By what right is he
a-interferin&#8217; now?&#8221;</p>

<p>I got to my feet. &#8220;<i>This</i> right, boss:&#8221; I says,
&#8220;I love Macie.&#8221;</p>

<p>He begun to kinda swell&#8211;gradual. And if a
look could &#8217;a&#8217; kilt me, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; keeled over that
second.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;love&#8211;Macie!&#8221; he says slow. &#8220;Wal ,
I&#8217;ll be darned if you haven&#8217;t got <i>cheek!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry you look at it that way, boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you got the idear into that peanut
haid of yourn&#8221;&#8211;he was sarcastic now&#8211;&#8220;that
you could marry my gal! Honest, I ain&#8217;t met a
bigger idjit &#8217;n you in ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No man but Mace&#8217;s paw could say that t&#8217; me
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he goes on, &#8220;you could just about
be President of the United States as easy as you
could be the husband of this gal. M&#8217; son, I think
I tole you on one occasion that you&#8217;d play Cupid
just oncet too many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is <i>it</i>. And, also, I tole you that the
smarty who can allus bring other folks t&#8217;gether
never can hitch hisself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;You got a good mem&#8217;ry, Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mace broke in then&#8211;feard they&#8217;d be trouble,
I reckon. &#8220;Please let&#8217;s cut this short,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;The only thing I want Alec to remember is that
I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; be bossed by <i>no</i> man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sewell patted her on the shoulder. &#8220;That&#8217;s
my gal a-talkin&#8217;!&#8221; he says. &#8220;Bully fer you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mace,&#8221; I says, &#8220;a-all <i>right.</i>&#8221; And
I took up my Stetson.</p>

<p>The ole man dropped into a chair and begun t&#8217;
laugh. (Could laugh now, thinkin&#8217; it was all up
&#8217;twixt Mace and me.) &#8220;Haw! haw! haw!&#8221; he
started off, slappin&#8217; one knee. &#8220;Mister Cupid
cain&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; fer hisself!&#8221; Then he laid back
and just <i>hollered,</i> slingin&#8217; out his laig with ev&#8217;ry
cackle; and pawin&#8217; the air fin&#8217;lly, he got so short-winded.
&#8220;Aw, lawdy!&#8221; he yelled; &#8220;aw&#8211;I&#8217;ll
<i>bust</i>. Mister <i>Cupid! Whew!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I got hot. &#8220;You found a he-he&#8217;s aig in a haw-haw&#8217;s
nest,&#8221; I begun. &#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll say back to
you what you oncet said to me: <i>Just wait.</i>&#8221;
Then I faced Macie. &#8220;All right, little gal,&#8221; I
says to her, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you know best. Pack you&#8217;
duds and go East&#8211;and sing on the stage in Noo
York.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>The ole man &#8217;d stopped laughin&#8217; t&#8217; listen. Now
he sit up straight, a hand on each arm of the
chair, knees spread, mouth wider open &#8217;n ever,
eyes plumb crossed. &#8220;Go East!&#8221; he repeats,
&#8220;&#8211;sing!&#8211;stage!&#8211;Noo York!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mace showed her sand, all right. &#8220;Yas,&#8221; she
answers; &#8220;you got it <i>exac&#8217;ly</i> right, paw&#8211;Noo
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>He riz up, face as white as anythin&#8217; so sunbaked
can look. &#8220;Git that crazy idear outen you&#8217;
brain this <i>minute!</i>&#8221; he begun. &#8220;I won&#8217;t allow
you t&#8217; stir a <i>step!</i> The stage! Lawd a-mighty!
Why, <i>you</i> ain&#8217;t got no voice fer the stage. You
can only squawk.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was mighty pretty t&#8217; see &#8217;em&#8211;father and
daughter&#8211;standin&#8217; out agin each other. Alike
in temper as two peas, y&#8217; savvy. And I knowed
somethin&#8217; was shore goin&#8217; to pop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Squawk!&#8221; repeats Mace. (<i>That</i> was the
finishin&#8217; touch.) &#8220;I&#8217;ll just show you! Some day
when my voice&#8217;s made me famous, you&#8217;ll be
sorry fer that. And you, too, Alec Lloyd, if you
<i>do</i> think my voice is all taffy. I&#8217;ll show you
<i>both!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; Sewell come back, &#8220;you don&#8217;t use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
none of <i>my</i> money fer t&#8217; make you&#8217; show.&#8221; He
was pretty nigh screechin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till I <i>ast</i> you fer it,&#8221; she says, pert
haid up again. &#8220;<i>Keep</i> you&#8217; money. I can earn
my own. <i>I</i> ain&#8217;t scairt of work.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just like she was, in the little, white dress
she used t&#8217; meet me in&#8211;she up and walked
out!</p>

<p>Now, it was the ole man&#8217;s turn t&#8217; walk the
floor. &#8220;Noo York!&#8221; he begun, his eyes dartin&#8217;
fire. &#8220;Did y&#8217; ever <i>hear</i> such a blamed fool proposition!
Doc Simpson is <i>re</i>sponsible fer that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been goin&#8217; on fer quite a spell,&#8221; I says.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know how far till just afore you
come in. Simpson, a-course, is the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>That second, <i>clickety</i>&#8211;<i>clickety</i>&#8211;<i>clickety</i>&#8211;<i>click!</i>&#8211;a
hoss was a-passin&#8217; the house on the
dead run. We both looked. It was that bald-faced
bronc of Macie&#8217;s, makin&#8217; fer the gate like
a streak of lightnin&#8217;. And the little gal was in
the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s goin&#8217;, boss,&#8221; I says. (The bald-face
was haided towards Briggs.)</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Let</i> her go,&#8221; says Sewell. &#8220;Let her ride off
her mad.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I&#8217;m t&#8217; blame fer this kick-up.
Yas, I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>And <i>I</i> begun t&#8217; walk the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, no use bellyachin&#8217; about it,&#8221; he answers.
&#8220;But you&#8217;re allus a-stickin&#8217; in that lip of yourn.
And&#8211;you&#8217;ll <i>re</i>call what I oncet said concernin&#8217;
the feller that sticks in his lip.&#8221; (I could see it
made him feel better t&#8217; think he had the bulge on
me.)</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t come back,&#8221; I goes on. (I felt
pretty bad, I can tell y&#8217;.) &#8220;No, boss, she won&#8217;t.
I know that gal better&#8217;n you do. She&#8217;s gone t&#8217;
Briggs, and she&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be back in a&#8217; hour. Rose cain&#8217;t keep
her, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was outen the room and makin&#8217; fer the
bunk-house. When I got there, I begun t&#8217; change
my clothes.</p>

<p>Hairoil was inside. (He&#8217;d been a-listenin&#8217; to
the rumpus, likely.) &#8220;Don&#8217;t go off half-cocked,&#8221;
he says to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid&#8217;s drunk,&#8221; says Monkey Mike.
&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s hit him with a bar-towel.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I knowed what I was a-goin&#8217; to do. Two
wags of a dawg&#8217;s tail, and I was in the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
again, facin&#8217; the ole man. &#8220;Sewell,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I
want my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;, Cupid?&#8221; he ast, reachin&#8217;
into his britches-pocket.</p>

<p>I took my little forty dollars and run it into
my buckskin sack. &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; into Briggs,&#8221; I
says, &#8220;t&#8217; see if I can talk some sense into that
gal&#8217;s haid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ole man give a kinda sour laugh. &#8220;Mebbe
you think you can bring her home on hossback
again,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Wal, just remember, if she
turns loose one of her tantrums, that you poured
out this drench you&#8217;self. It&#8217;s like that there feller
in Kansas.&#8221; And he give that laugh of hisn
again. &#8220;Ever heerd about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I says; &#8220;no, what about you&#8217; Kansas
feller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221;&#8211;the boss pulled out a plug of t&#8217;bacca,&#8211;&#8220;he bought a house and lot fer five hunderd
dollars. The lot was guaranteed to raise anythin&#8217;,
and the house was painted the prettiest kind
of a green. Natu&#8217;lly, he thought he owned &#8217;em.
Wal, things went smooth till one night when he
was away from home. Then a blamed cyclone
come along. Shore enough, that lot of hisn could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
raise. It raised plumb into the air, house and all,
and the hull business blowed into the neighbourin&#8217;
State!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What goes up must come down,&#8217; says the
feller. And knowin&#8217; which way that cyclone
travelled, he started in the same <i>di</i>rection, hotfoot.
He goes and goes. Fin&#8217;lly he comes to a
ranch where they was a new barn goin&#8217; up. It was
a pinto proposition. Part of it wasn&#8217;t painted,
and some of it was green. He stopped to demand
portions of his late residence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man he spoke to quit drivin&#8217; nails just
long enough to answer. &#8216;When you Kansas folks
git up one of them baby cyclones of yourn,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;fer Heaven&#8217;s sake have sand enough to accept
the hand-out it gives y&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I savvy what you mean,&#8221; I says to the ole
man, &#8220;but you fergit that in this case the moccasin
don&#8217;t fit. Another man&#8217;s behind this, boss.
The little gal has ketched singin&#8217;-bugs. And
when she gits enough cash<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can <i>she</i> git cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The eatin&#8217;-house is short of, help, Sewell.
She can git a job easy&#8211;passin&#8217; fancy Mulligan
to the pilgrims that go through.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>Say! that knocked all the sarcastic laughin&#8217;
outen him. A&#8217; awful anxious look come into his
face. &#8220;Why&#8211;why, Cupid,&#8221; he begun. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t reckon she&#8217;d go do that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, <i>Clickety</i>&#8211;<i>clickety</i>&#8211;<i>clickety</i>&#8211;<i>click</i>
a hoss was comin&#8217; along the road. We both got
to a winda. It was that bald-faced bronc of
Macie&#8217;s again, haid down and tail out. But the
bridle-reins was caught &#8217;round the pommel t&#8217;
keep &#8217;em from gittin&#8217; under foot, and the little

<p>It was Macie Sewell singin&#8217;. Ole Number 201
&#8217;d just pulled outen Briggs City, haided southwest
with her freight of tenderfeet, and with
Ingineer Dave Reynolds stickin&#8217; in his spurs
to make up lost time. The passengers &#8217;d had
twenty-five minutes fer a good grubbin&#8217;-up at
the eatin&#8217;-house, and now the little gal was help-in&#8217;
the balance of the Harvey bunch to clear off
the lunch-counter. Whilst she worked, she was
chirpin&#8217; away like she&#8217;d plumb bust her throat.</p>

<p>I was outside, settin&#8217; on a truck with Up-State.
He was watchin&#8217; acrosst the rails, straight afore
him, and listenin&#8217;, and I could see he was swallerin&#8217;
some, and his eyes looked kinda like he&#8217;d
been ridin&#8217; agin the wind. When I shifted my
<i>po</i>sition, he turned the other way quick, and
coughed&#8211;that pore little gone-in cough of hisn.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>Wal, I felt pretty bad myself; and I seen somethin&#8217;
turrible was wrong with Up-State&#8211;I
couldn&#8217;t just make out what. Pretty soon, I put
my hand on his arm, and I says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
t&#8217; worm anythin&#8217; outen you, ole man; I just want
t&#8217; say I&#8217;m you&#8217; friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he whispers back, &#8220;it&#8217;s The Mohawk
Vale.&#8221;</p>

<p>(He allus whispered, y&#8217; savvy; couldn&#8217;t talk
out loud no more, bein&#8217; so turrible shy on
lung.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a bony fido place?&#8221; I ast, &#8220;&#8217;r just
made up a-purpose fer the song?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>my</i> country,&#8221; he whispers, slow and
husky, and begun gazin&#8217; acrosst to the mesquite
again. &#8220;And, Cupid, it&#8217;s a <i>beau</i>tiful country!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; I says. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely got Oklahomaw
skinned t&#8217; death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up-State, he didn&#8217;t answer that&#8211;too <i>po</i>lite.
Aw, he was a gent, too, same as the parson.</p>

<p>Minute &#8217;r so, Macie struck up again&#8211;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>Up-State lent over, elbows on his knees, face
in his hands, and begun tremblin&#8217;&#8211;Why, y&#8217;
know, even a <i>hoss</i> &#8217;ll git homesick. Now, I brung
a flea-bitten mare from down on the lower Cimarron
oncet, and blamed if that little son-of-a-gun
didn&#8217;t hoof it all the way back, straighter
&#8217;n a string! Yas, ma&#8217;am. And so, a-course, it&#8217;s
natu&#8217;al fer a <i>man</i>. Wal, I ketched on to how
things was with Up-State, and I moseyed.</p>

<p>I was at the deepot pretty frequent them
days&#8211;waitin&#8217;. Macie hadn&#8217;t talked to me none
yet, and mebbe she wouldn&#8217;t. But I was on hand
in case the notion &#8217;d strike her.</p>

<p>Her hangin&#8217; out agin me and her paw tickled
them eatin&#8217;-house Mamies turrible. They
thought her idear of earnin&#8217; her own money, and
then goin&#8217; East to be a&#8217; op&#8217;ra singer, was just
<i>grand</i>.</p>

<p>But the rest of the town felt diff&#8217;rent. And
behind my back all the women folks and the boys
that knowed me was sayin&#8217; it was a darned shame.
They figgered that a gal gone loco on the stage
proposition wouldn&#8217;t make <i>no</i> kind of a wife fer
a cow-punch. &#8220;Would <i>she</i> camp down in Oklahomaw,&#8221;
they says, &#8220;and cook three meals a day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
and wash out blue shirts, when she&#8217;s set on gittin&#8217;
up afore a passel of highflyers and yelpin&#8217;
&#8216;Marguerite&#8217;? <i>Nixey.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Next thing, one day at Silverstein&#8217;s, here come
the parson to me, lookin&#8217; worried. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;git on the good side of that gal as quick
as ever you can&#8211;and marry her. The stage is
a&#8217; <i>awful</i> place fer a decent gal. Keep her offen
it if you love her soul. And if I can help, just
whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said thank y&#8217;, but I was feard marryin&#8217; was
a long way off.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Alec,&#8221; goes on the parson, &#8220;that Simpson
has gone back t&#8217; Noo York<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas. He put all his doctor truck into his
gasoline wagon last night and choo-chooed outen
town. If <i>he&#8217;s</i> there, and <i>she</i> goes, wal,&#8211;I don&#8217;t
like the looks of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t neither, parson. He&#8217;s crooked as a
cow-path, that feller. Have you tole her paw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I will,&#8221; says the parson.</p>

<p>I went over to the deepot again. Havin&#8217; done
a little thinkin&#8217;, I wasn&#8217;t so scairt about Simpson
by now. &#8217;Cause why? Wal, y&#8217; see, I knowed</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>Mace didn&#8217;t have no money; ole Sewell wouldn&#8217;t
give her none; and she wasn&#8217;t the kind of a gal t&#8217;
borra. So it was likely she&#8217;d be in Briggs fer
quite a spell.</p>

<p>I found Up-State settin&#8217; outside the eatin&#8217;-house.
I sit down byside him. Allus, them days,
whenever I come in sight of the station, he was
a-hangin&#8217; &#8217;round, y&#8217; savvy. He&#8217;d be on a truck,
say, &#8217;r mebbe on the edge of the platform. If it
was all quiet inside at the lunch-counter, he&#8217;d be
watchin&#8217; the mesquite, and sorta swingin&#8217; his
shoes. But if Macie was singin&#8217;, he&#8217;d be all
scrooched over with his face covered up&#8211;and
pretty quiet.</p>

<p>When Macie sung, it was The Mohawk Vale
ev&#8217;ry time. Now, that seemed funny, bein&#8217; she
was mad at me and that was my fav&#8217;rite song.
Then, it didn&#8217;t seem so funny. One of the eatin&#8217;-house
gals tole me, confidential, that Up-State
had lots of little chins with Macie acrosst the
lunch-counter, and that The Mohawk Vale was
&#8220;by request.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>I</i> didn&#8217;t keer. Let Up-State talk to her as
much as he wanted to. <i>He</i> couldn&#8217;t make me
jealous&#8211;not on you&#8217; life! I wasn&#8217;t the finest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
lookin&#8217; man in Oklahomaw, and I wasn&#8217;t on right
good terms with Mace. But Up-State&#8211;wal,
Up-State was pretty clost t&#8217; crossin&#8217; the Big
Divide.</p>

<p>All this time not a word &#8217;d passed &#8217;twixt Macie
and her paw. The ole man was too stiff-necked
t&#8217; give in and go to her. (He was figgerin&#8217; that
she&#8217;d git tired and come home.) And Macie, she
wasn&#8217;t tired a blamed bit, and she was too stiff-necked
t&#8217; give in and go t&#8217; Sewell.</p>

<p>Wal, when the boss heerd about Up-State and
Mace, you never <i>seen</i> a man so sore. He said
Up-State was aigin&#8217; her on, and no white man &#8217;d
do <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Y&#8217; see, he had some reason fer not goin&#8217; shucks
on the singin&#8217; and actin&#8217; breed. We&#8217;d had two
bunches of op&#8217;ra folks in Briggs at diff&#8217;rent
times. One come down from Wichita, and was
called &#8220;The Way to Ruin.&#8221; (Wal, it shore
looked its name!) The other was &#8220;The Wild
West Troupe&#8221; from Dallas. This last wasn&#8217;t
West&#8211;it was from Noo York <i>di</i>rect&#8211;but you
can bet you&#8217; boots it was <i>wild</i> all right. By
thunder! you couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; helt nary one of them
young ladies with a hoss-hair rope!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>But fer a week of Sundays, he didn&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217; to Up-State. He just boiled inside,
kinda. Then one day&#8211;when he&#8217;d got enough
steam up, I reckon,&#8211;why, he opened wide and
let her go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up-State,&#8221; he begun, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry fer you,
all right, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Up-State looked at him. &#8220;Sewell,&#8221; he whispers,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want <i>no</i> man&#8217;s pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; says the boss. &#8220;Macie&#8217;s my
little gal&#8211;the only child I got left now, and I
warn you not to go talkin&#8217; actress to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t holler &#8217;fore you git hit,&#8221; whispers Up-State,
smilin&#8217;.</p>

<p>The boss got worse mad then. &#8220;Look a-here,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;don&#8217;t give me none of that. You know
you lie<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Up-State shook his haid. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a man any
more, Sewell,&#8221; he whispers. &#8220;I&#8217;m just what&#8217;s
left of one. I didn&#8217;t used to let <i>no</i>body hand out
things that flat to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stuck in <i>my</i> lip. (<i>One</i> more time couldn&#8217;t
hurt.) &#8220;Now, Sewell,&#8221; I says, &#8220;put on the
brake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got a holt on hisself then. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
josh to me, Cupid,&#8221; he says. (He was tremblin&#8217;,
pore ole cuss!) &#8220;What you think I heerd this
mornin&#8217;? Mace ain&#8217;t makin&#8217; enough money passin&#8217;
slumgullion to them passenger cattle all day,
so she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; over to Silverstein&#8217;s ev&#8217;ry night
after this to fix up his books. I wisht now I&#8217;d
never sent her t&#8217; business college.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up-State lent over, his elbows on his knees,
and his face in his hands.</p>

<p>The boss looked at me. I give a jerk of my
haid to show him he&#8217;d best go. And he walked
off, grindin&#8217; his teeth.</p>

<p>It seemed to me I could hear Up-State whisperin&#8217;
into his fingers. I stooped over. &#8220;What is
it, pardner?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s full of home,&#8221; he says, &#8220;&#8211;it&#8217;s full of

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>Doc Trowbridge stopped by just then. &#8220;How
you makin&#8217; it t&#8217;-day, Up-State?&#8221; he ast.</p>

<p>Up-State got to his feet, slow though, and
put a hand on Billy&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;The next sandstorm,
ole man,&#8221; he says; &#8220;the next sandstorm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up-State,&#8221; says Billy, &#8220;buck up. You got
more lives&#8217;n a cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No show,&#8221; Up-State whispers back.</p>

<p>He was funny that-a-way. Now, most lungers
fool theyselves. Allus &#8220;goin&#8217; to git better,&#8221;
y&#8217; savvy. But Up-State&#8211;<i>he knew</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over to my tent t&#8217;-night,&#8221; he goes on
to Billy. &#8220;I got somethin&#8217; I want to talk to you
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; says Billy. &#8220;Two haids is better
&#8217;n one, if one <i>is</i> a sheep&#8217;s haid.&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper, I passed Silverstein&#8217;s two &#8217;r
three times, and about nine o&#8217;clock I seen Macie.
She was &#8217;way back towards the end of the store,
a lamp and a book in front of her; and she was
a-workin&#8217; like a steam-thrasher.</p>

<p>Somehow it come over me all to oncet then that
she&#8217;d meant ev&#8217;ry single word she said, and that,
sooner &#8217;r later&#8211;she was goin&#8217;. <i>Goin&#8217;</i>. And I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
be stayin&#8217; behind. I looked &#8217;round me. Say!
Briggs City didn&#8217;t show up <i>much</i>. &#8220;Without
<i>her,</i>&#8221; I says, (they was that red-hot-iron feelin&#8217;
inside of me again) &#8220;&#8211;without her, what is it?&#8211;the jumpin&#8217;-off place!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond me, a piece, was Up-State&#8217;s tent. A
light was burnin&#8217; inside it, too, and Doc Trowbridge
was settin&#8217; in the moonlight by the openin&#8217;.
Behind him, I could see Up-State, writin&#8217;.</p>

<p>I trailed home to my bunk. But you can understand
I didn&#8217;t sleep good. And &#8217;way late, I had
a dream. I dreamed the Bar Y herd broke fence
and stampeded through Briggs, and after &#8217;em
come about a hunderd bull-whackers, all a-layin&#8217;
it on to them steers with the flick of they lashes
<i>-zip, zip, zip, zip</i>.</p>

<p>Next mornin, I woke quick&#8211;with a jump,
y&#8217; might say. I looked at my nickel turnip. It
was five-thirty. I got up. The sun was shinin&#8217;,
the air was nice and clear and quiet and the larks
was just singin&#8217; away. But outside, along the
winda-sill, was stretched <i>a&#8217; inch-wide trickle of
sand!</i></p>

<p>In no time I was hoofin&#8217; it down the street.
When I got to Up-State&#8217;s tent, Billy Trowbridge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
was inside it, movin&#8217; &#8217;round, puttin&#8217; stuff
into a trunk, and&#8211;wipin&#8217; the sand outen his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was right?&#8221; I says, when I goes in, steppin&#8217;
soft, and whisperin&#8217;&#8211;like Up-State &#8217;d allus
whispered. Billy turned to me and kinda smiled,
fer all he felt so all-fired bad. &#8220;Yas, Cupid,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;he was right. One more storm.&#8221;</p>

back to the Mohawk.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Up-State left two letters behind him&#8211;one
fer me and one fer Billy. The doc didn&#8217;t show
hisn; said it wouldn&#8217;t be just <i>pro</i>feshnal&#8211;yet.
But mine he ast me to read to the boss.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Cupid,</i>&#8221; it run, &#8220;<i>ast Mister Sewell not
to come down too hard on me account of what
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do fer Macie. The little gal says
she wants a singin&#8217; chanst more&#8217;n anythin&#8217; else.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>Wal, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give it to her. You&#8217;ll find a&#8217;
even five hunderd in green-backs over in Silverstein&#8217;s
safe. It&#8217;s hern. Tell her I want she should
use it to go to Noo York on and buck the op&#8217;ra

</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>Wal, y&#8217; see, the ole man &#8217;d been right all along&#8211;Up-State <i>was</i> sidin&#8217; with Mace. Somehow
though, <i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t feel hard agin him fer it. I
knowed that she&#8217;d go&#8211;help &#8217;r <i>no</i> help.</p>

<p>But Sewell, he didn&#8217;t think like me, and I
never <i>seen</i> a man take on the way he done.
<i>Crazy</i> mad, he was, swore blue blazes, and said
things that didn&#8217;t sound so nice when a feller remembered
that Up-State was face up and flat on
his back fer keeps&#8211;and goin&#8217; home in the baggage-car.</p>

<p>I tell you, the boys was nice to me that day.
&#8220;The little gal won&#8217;t fergit y&#8217;, Cupid,&#8221; they
says, and &#8220;Never you mind, Cupid, it&#8217;ll all come
out in the wash.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked &#8217;em, a-course. But with Macie fixed
to go (far&#8217;s money went), and without makin&#8217;
friends with me, neither, what under the shinin&#8217;
sun could chirk <i>me</i> up? Wal, <i>nothin&#8217;</i> could.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER SEVEN<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BOYS PUT THEY FOOT IN IT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Wal</span>, Hairoil,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I shore am a&#8217; unlucky
geezer! Why, d&#8217; you know, I don&#8217;t hardly
dast go from one room to another these days fer
fear I&#8217;ll git my lip pinched in the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil, he clawed thoughtful. &#8220;You and
the boss had a talk oncet on the marryin&#8217; question,&#8221;
he begun. &#8220;It was out at the Bar Y.&#8221;
(We was settin&#8217; on a truck at the deepot again,
same as that other time.) &#8220;A-course, I don&#8217;t
want t&#8217; throw nothin&#8217; up, but&#8211;you tole him then
that when it come you&#8217; <i>own</i> time, <i>you</i> wouldn&#8217;t
have no trouble. Recollect braggin&#8217; that-a-way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; I answers, meeker&#8217;n Moses. &#8220;But
Hairoil, that was &#8217;fore I met Macie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was,&#8221; he says. Then, after a minute,
&#8220;I s&#8217;pose nothin&#8217; could keep her in Briggs much
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my haid. &#8220;The ole man won&#8217;t let her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
fetch a dud offen the ranch, and so she&#8217;s havin&#8217;
a couple of dresses made. I figger that when
<i>they</i> git done, she&#8217;ll&#8211;she&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long from now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About two weeks&#8211;accordin&#8217; to what Mollie
Brown tole me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; says Hairoil, and went on chawin&#8217; his
cud. Fin&#8217;lly, he begun again, and kinda like he
was feelin&#8217; &#8217;round. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think Mace
Sewell is took up with the <i>ro</i>mance part of this
singin&#8217; proposition?&#8221; he ast. &#8220;That&#8217;s <i>my</i> idear.
And <i>I</i> think that if she was showed that her and
you was <i>also</i> a <i>ro</i>mance, why, she&#8217;d give up goin&#8217;
to Noo York. Now, it <i>might</i> be possible to&#8211;to
git her t&#8217; see things right&#8211;if they was a little
scheme, say.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got up. &#8220;No, Hairoil,&#8221; I says, &#8220;no little
scheme is a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; be played on <i>Macie</i>. A-course,
I done it fer Rose and Billy; but Macie,&#8211;wal,
Macie is diff&#8217;rent. I want t&#8217; win her in the open.
And I&#8217;ll be jiggered if I stand fer any underhand
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needn&#8217;t t&#8217; <i>be</i> what you&#8217;d call underhand,&#8221;
answers Hairoil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardner,&#8221; I says, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk about it no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
more. You make me plumb nervous, like crumbs
in the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so he shut up.</p>

<p>But now when I <i>re</i>call that conversation of
ourn, and think back on what begun t&#8217; happen
right afterwards, it seemed <i>blamed</i> funny that I
didn&#8217;t suspicion somethin&#8217; was wrong. The parson
was mixed up in it, y&#8217; savvy, and the sheriff,
and Billy Trowbridge&#8211;all them three I&#8217;d helped
out in one way &#8217;r another. And Hairoil was in
it, too&#8211;and he&#8217;d said oncet that he was a-goin&#8217;
t&#8217; marry me off. So <i>why</i> didn&#8217;t I ketch on! Wal,
I shore <i>was</i> a yap!</p>

<p>Next day, Hairoil didn&#8217;t even speak of Mace.
I thought he&#8217;d clean fergot about her. He was
all <i>ex</i>cited over somethin&#8217; else&#8211;the &#8217;lection of
a sheriff. And &#8217;fore he got done tellin&#8217; me about
it, I was some <i>ex</i>cited, too&#8211;fer all I was half
sick account of my own troubles.</p>

<p>The &#8217;lection of a sheriff, y&#8217; savvy, means a&#8217;
awful lot to a passel of cow-punchers. We don&#8217;t
much keer who&#8217;s President of the United States.
(We been plumb <i>covered</i> with proud flesh these
six years, though, &#8217;cause Roos&#8217;velt, <i>he&#8217;s</i> a
puncher.) We don&#8217;t much keer, neither, who&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
Gov&#8217;ner of Oklahomaw. But you can bet you&#8217;
bottom dollar it makes a <i>heap</i> of diff&#8217;rence
who&#8217;s our sheriff. If you git a friend in office,
you can breathe easy when you have a little disagreement;
if you don&#8217;t, why, <i>you</i> git &#8217;lected&#8211;t&#8217;
the calaboose!</p>

<p>Now, what Hairoil come and rep&#8217;esented to
me was this: That Hank Shackleton, editor of
<i>The Briggs City Eye-Opener,</i> &#8217;d been lickerin&#8217;
up somethin&#8217; <i>turrible</i> the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank?&#8221; I says to Hairoil, plumb surprised.
&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t know he ever took more &#8217;n a
glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>glass!</i>&#8221; repeats Hairoil disgusted. &#8220;He
ain&#8217;t used no glass <i>this</i> time; he used a <i>funnel</i>.
And you oughta see his paper that come out
this mornin&#8217;. It&#8217;s full on the one side, where a
story&#8217;s allus printed, but the opp&#8217;site page looks
like somethin&#8217; &#8217;d hit it&#8211;O. K. far&#8217;s advertisements
go, but the news is as skurse as hen&#8217;s teeth,
<i>and not a word about Bergin.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! But&#8211;what does that matter,
Hairoil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that <i>matter!</i> Why, if Hank gits
it into his haid to keep on tankin&#8217; that-a-way (till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
he plumb spills over, by jingo!) the <i>Eye-Opener</i>
won&#8217;t show up again fer a month of Sundays.
Now, we need it, account of this &#8217;lection, and the
way Hank is actin&#8217; has come home to roost with
ev&#8217;ry <i>one</i> of us. You been worried, Cupid, and
you ain&#8217;t noticed how this sheriff sittywaytion is.
The Goldstone <i>Tarantula</i> is behind the <i>Re</i>publican
can<i>di</i>date, Walker<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Walker! That</i> critter up fer sheriff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas. And, a-course, Hank&#8217;s been behind
Bergin t&#8217; git <i>him</i> re&#8217;lected fer the &#8217;leventh time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know, and Bergin&#8217;s got t&#8217; <i>win</i>. Why, Bergin&#8217;s
the only fit man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, now, if our paper cain&#8217;t git in and
crow the loudest, and tell how many kinds of a
swine the other feller is, <i>how&#8217;s</i> Bergin goin&#8217; t&#8217;
win?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do <i>I</i>. (You see how ticklish things
is?) Wal, here&#8217;s Hank in <i>no</i> shape to make any
kind of a newspaper fight, but just achin&#8217; t&#8217;
use his gun on anybody that comes nigh him.
Why, I never <i>seen</i> such a change in a man in
all my born <i>life!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I was surprised some <i>more</i>. I didn&#8217;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
Hank <i>packed</i> a gun. He was a darned nice cuss,
and ev&#8217;rybody shore liked him, and he&#8217;d never
been laid up fer <i>re</i>pairs account of somethin&#8217;
he&#8217;d put in his paper. He was square, smart&#8217;s a
steel-trap, and white clean through. Had a handshake
that was hung on a hair-trigger, and a
smile so winnin&#8217; that he could coax the little prairie-dawgs
right outen they holes.</p>

<p>Hairoil goes on. &#8220;I can see Briggs City eatin&#8217;
the shucks when it comes &#8217;lection-day,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;and that Goldstone man cabbagin&#8217; the sheriff&#8217;s
office. Buckshot Milliken tole me this mornin&#8217;
that the <i>Tarantula</i> called Bergin &#8216;a slouch&#8217; last
week; &#8216;so low-down he'd eat sheep,&#8217; too, and
&#8216;such a blamed pore shot he couldn&#8217;t hit the side
of a barn.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s goin&#8217; too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>I</i> say. I wanted Bergin t&#8217; go over to
Goldstone and give &#8217;em a sample of his gun-play
that&#8217;d interfere with the printin&#8217; of they
one-hoss sheet. But Bergin said it was no use&#8211;the <i>Tarantula</i> editor is wearin&#8217; a sheet-iron
thing-um-a-jig acrosst his back and his front,
and has to use a screw-driver t&#8217; take off his
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;The idear of Hank actin&#8217; like a idjit when
the &#8217;lection depends on him!&#8221; I says. &#8220;Wal,
things <i>is</i> outen kilter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh-sh-sh!&#8221; says Hairoil, lookin&#8217; round quick.
&#8220;Be awful keerful what you say about Hank.
We don&#8217;t want no shootin&#8217;-scrape <i>here.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t give a continental <i>who</i> heerd me.
I was sore t&#8217; think a reg&#8217;lar jay-hawk &#8217;d been
put up agin our man! Say, that Walker didn&#8217;t
know beans when the bag was open. His name
shore fit him, &#8217;cause he couldn&#8217;t ride a hoss fer
cold potatoes. And he was the kind that gals
think is a looker, and allus stood ace-high at a
dance. Lately, he&#8217;d been more pop&#8217;lar than ever.
When we had that little set-to with Spain,
Walker hiked out to the Coast; and didn&#8217;t show
up again till after the California boys come home
from Manila. Then, he hit town, wearin&#8217; a&#8217; army
hat, and chuck full of all kinds of stories about
the Philippines, and how he&#8217;d been in <i>turrible</i>
fights. That got the girls travelin&#8217; after him two-forty.
Why, at Goldstone, they was <i>all</i> a-goin&#8217;
with him, seems like.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want <i>him</i> fer sheriff, you bet you&#8217;
boots. He wasn&#8217;t no friend to us Briggs City
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
boys any more &#8217;n we was to him. And then, none
of us believed that soldier hand-out. Y&#8217; know, we
had a little bunch of fellers from this section
that went down t&#8217; Cuba with Colonel Roos&#8217;velt
and chased the Spanish some. Wal, y&#8217; never
heerd <i>them</i> crowin&#8217; &#8217;round about what they done.
And this Walker, he blowed too much t&#8217; be
genuwine.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s &#8217;lected sheriff, it&#8217;s goin&#8217; t&#8217; be risky
business gittin&#8217; in to a&#8217; argyment with anybody,&#8221;
I says. &#8220;He&#8217;d just <i>like</i> t&#8217; git one of us jugged.
Say, what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be did fer Hank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; answers Hairoil, mouth screwed up
anxious, &#8220;we&#8217;re in a right serious fix. So they&#8217;s
to be a sorta convention this afternoon, and we&#8217;re
a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; cut out whisky whilst the session lasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come. <i>Walker</i> fer sheriff! <i>Huh!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good fer you! So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>We made fer the council-tent at three o&#8217;clock&#8211;the bunch of us. The deepot waitin&#8217;-room was
choosed, that bein&#8217;, as the boys put it, &#8220;the most
<i>re</i>spectable public place in town that wouldn&#8217;t
want rent.&#8221; Wal, we worked our jaws a lot,
goin&#8217; over the sittywaytion from start to finish.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
&#8220;Gents let&#8217;s hear what you-all got to say,&#8221; begun
Chub Flannagan, standin&#8217; up. Doc Trowbridge
was next. &#8220;<i>I ad</i>vise you to rope Shackleton,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;and lemme give him some hoss liniment
t&#8217; put him on his laigs.&#8221; (We was agreed that the
hull business depended on the <i>Eye-Opener</i>.) But
the rest of us didn&#8217;t favour Billy&#8217;s plan. So we
ended by pickin&#8217; a &#8217;lection committee. No dues,
no by-laws, no chairman. But ev&#8217;ry blamed one
of us a sergeant-at-arms with orders t&#8217; keep Hank
Shackleton <i>outen the saloons</i>. &#8217;Cause why? If
he could buck up, and <i>stay</i> straight, and go t&#8217;
gittin&#8217; out the <i>Eye-Opener,</i> Bergin &#8217;d shore win
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gents,&#8221; says Monkey Mike, &#8220;soon as ever
Briggs hears of our committee, we&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; t&#8217;
git pop&#8217;lar with the nice people, &#8217;cause we&#8217;re
tryin&#8217; t&#8217; help Hank. And we&#8217;re also goin&#8217; t&#8217; git
a black eye with the licker men account of shuttin&#8217;
off the Shackleton trade. A-course, us
punchers must try t&#8217; make it up t&#8217; the thirst-parlours
fer the loss, though I <i>ad</i>mit it &#8217;ll not be a&#8217;
easy proposition. But things is <i>desp</i>&#8217;rate. If
Walker gits in, we&#8217;ll have a nasty deputy-sheriff
sent up here t&#8217; cross us ev&#8217;ry time we make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
move. We got t&#8217; <i>work,</i> gents. You know how <i>I</i>
feel. By thunder! Bergin treated me square all
right over that Andrews fuss.&#8221; (Y&#8217; see, Mike&#8217;s
a grateful little devil, if he <i>does</i> ride like a fool
Englishman.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; says Buckshot Milliken, &#8220;who&#8217;ll be
the first sergeant? I call fer a volunteer.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the fellers just kept quiet&#8211;but they looked
at each other, worried like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t all speak to oncet,&#8221; says Buckshot.</p>

<p>I got up. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;</i>m willin&#8217; t&#8217; try my hand,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Thank</i> y&#8217;, Cupid.&#8221; It was Buckshot, earnest
as the dickens. &#8220;But&#8211;but we hope you&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to go slow with Hank. Don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; foolish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in thunder &#8217;s got <i>into</i> you fellers?&#8221; I
ast, lookin&#8217; at &#8217;em. &#8220;Is Hank got the hydrophoby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t saw him since he begun t&#8217; drink, I
reckon,&#8221; says Chub.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wal,</i> then.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, I was so all-fired et up with curiosity
t&#8217; git a look at Hank that I couldn&#8217;t stand
it no more. So I got a move on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>Hank is a turrible tall feller, and thin as a ramrod.
He&#8217;s got hair you could flag a train with,
and a face as speckled as a turkey aig. And
when I come on to him that day, here he was,
stretched out on the floor of Dutchy&#8217;s back room,
mouth wide open, and snorin&#8217; like a rip-saw.</p>

<p>I give his shoulder a jerk. &#8220;Here, Hank,&#8221; I
says, &#8220;wake up and pay fer you&#8217; keep. What&#8217;s
got into you, anyhow. My goodness me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes&#8211;slow. Next, he sit up,
and fixed a&#8217; awful ugly look on me. &#8220;Wa-a-al?&#8221;
he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; I begun, &#8220;Briggs City likes
you, and in the present case it&#8217;s a-tryin&#8217; t&#8217; make
&#8217;lowances, and not chalk nothin&#8217; agin y&#8217;, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blankety blank Briggs City!&#8221; growls Hank.
&#8220;Ish had me shober and ish had me drunk, and
neither way don&#8217;t shoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ole man, I reckon you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; I
says. &#8220;But never mind, anyhow. Just try t&#8217;
realise that they &#8217;s a &#8217;lection comin&#8217;, and that you
got t&#8217; help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walkersh a friend of mine,&#8221; says Hank, and
laid down again.</p>

<p>Wal, I didn&#8217;t want t&#8217; be there all day. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
wanted t&#8217; have <i>some</i> time to myself, y&#8217; savvy, so
&#8217;s I could keep track of Mace. So I grabbed him
again.</p>

<p>This whack, he got up, straddlin&#8217; his feet out
like a mad tarantula, and kinda clawin&#8217; the air.
They wasn&#8217;t no gun visible on him, but he was
loaded, all right. Had a revolver stuck under his
belt in front, so &#8217;s the bottom of his vest hid it.</p>

<p>I jerked it out and kicked it clean acrosst the
floor. Then I drug him out and started fer the
bunk-house with him. <i>Gosh!</i> it was a job!</p>

<p>Wal, the pore cuss didn&#8217;t git another swalla
of forty-rod that day; and by the next mornin&#8217;
he was calm and had a&#8217; appetite. So three of us
sergeant-at-arms happened over to see him. Bill
Rawson was there a&#8217;ready, keepin&#8217; him comp&#8217;ny.
And first thing y&#8217; know, I was handin&#8217; that editor
of ourn great big slathers of straight talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know what you done fer me, Cupid,&#8221; says
Hank. &#8220;And I&#8217;m grateful,&#8211;yas, I am. But let
me tell you that when I git started drinkin&#8217;, I
cain&#8217;t <i>stop</i>&#8211;never do till I&#8217;m just wored out &#8217;r
stone broke. And I git mean, and on the fight,
and don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doin&#8217;. But,&#8221; he <i>con</i>-tinues
(his face was as long as you&#8217; arm), &#8220;if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
you-all &#8217;ll fergive me, and let this spree pass,
why, I&#8217;ll go back t&#8217; takin&#8217; water at the railroad
tank with the Sante Fee ingines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank,&#8221; I says, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t t&#8217; say nothin&#8217;
further. But pack no more loads, m&#8217; son, pack
no more loads. And <i>try</i> t&#8217; git out another <i>EyeOpener</i>.
Not only is this sheriff matter pressin&#8217;,
but the lit&#8217;rary standin&#8217; of Briggs City is at
stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dead right,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll git
up a&#8217; issue of the <i>Opener</i> pronto&#8211;only you boys
&#8217;ll have t&#8217; help me out some on the news part. I
don&#8217;t recollect much that&#8217;s been happenin&#8217;
lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, things looked cheerfuller. So, &#8217;fore long,
I was back at the deepot, settin&#8217; on a truck and
watchin&#8217; the eatin&#8217;-house windas, and the boys&#8211;Bergin
and all&#8211;was lined up &#8217;longside Dutchy&#8217;s
bar, celebratin&#8217;.</p>

<p>But our work was a long, l-o-n-g way from
bein&#8217; done. Hank kept sober just five hours.
Then he got loose from Hairoil and made fer a
thirst-parlour. And when Hairoil found him
again, he was fuller&#8217;n a tick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m blue as all git out about what&#8217;s happened,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
says Hairoil. &#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t help it;
it was just rotten luck. And I hear that when the
<i>Tarantula</i> come out yesterday it had a hull column
about that Walker, callin&#8217; him a brave ex-soldier
and the next sheriff of Woodward
County.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And just ten days &#8217;fore &#8217;lection!&#8221; chips in
Bill Rawson. &#8220;Cupid, it&#8217;s root hawg &#8217;r die!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll go git
after Hank again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in Dutchy&#8217;s, same as afore. But not
so loaded, this time, and a blamed sight uglier.
Minute he <i>seen</i> me, his back was up! &#8220;Here, you
snide puncher,&#8221; he begun, &#8220;you tryin&#8217; to arrest
<i>me?</i> Wal, blankety blank blank,&#8221; (fill it in the
worst you can think of&#8211;he was beefin&#8217; somethin&#8217;
<i>awful</i>) &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you know that I ain&#8217;t never
&#8217;lowed <i>no</i> man t&#8217; put the bracelets on me.&#8221; And
his hand went down and begun feelin&#8217; fer the butt
of a gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look oudt!&#8221; whispers Dutchy. &#8220;You vill
git shooted!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I only just walked over and put a&#8217; arm
&#8217;round Hank. &#8220;Now, come on home,&#8221; I says,
like I meant it. &#8220;&#8217;Cause y&#8217; know, day after t&#8217;-morra
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
another <i>Eye-Opener</i> has <i>got</i> to rise t&#8217; the
top. Hank, think of Bergin!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on me then, and give me such a
push in the chest that I sit down on the floor&#8211;right
suddent, too. Wal, that rubbed me the
wrong way. And the next thing <i>he</i> knowed, I
had him by the back of the collar, and was a-draggin&#8217;
him out.</p>

<p>I was plumb wored out by the time I got him
home, and so Chub, he stayed t&#8217; watch. I went
back to the deepot. And I was still a-settin&#8217; there,
feelin&#8217; lonesome, and kinda put out, too, when
here come Buckshot Milliken towards me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Hank oughta be &#8217;shamed of hisself,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;fer the way he talks about you. Course,
we know why he does it, and that it ain&#8217;t
true<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he got t&#8217; say about me?&#8221; I ast, huffy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said you was a ornery hoodlum,&#8221; answers
Buckshot, &#8220;and a loafer, and that he&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; t&#8217;
roast you in his paper. He&#8217;d put Oklahomaw on
to <i>you,</i> he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you been <i>such</i> a good friend t&#8217; Hank,&#8221;
goes on Buckshot. &#8220;Wal, don&#8217;t it go to show!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;If he puts on single <i>word</i> about me in that
paper of hisn,&#8221; I says, gittin&#8217; on my ear good
and plenty, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just natu&#8217;ally take him acrosst
my knee and give him a spankin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll put enough slugs in you t&#8217; make
a sinker,&#8221; answers Buckshot. &#8220;Why, Cupid,
Hank Shackleton can fight his weight in wildcats.
<i>You go slow.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>he</i> cain&#8217;t shoot,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;He cain&#8217;t <i>shoot!</i>&#8221; repeats Buckshot. &#8220;Why,
I hear he was a reg&#8217;lar gun-fighter oncet, and so
blamed fancy with his shootin&#8217; that he could drive
a two-penny nail into a plank at twenty yards
ev&#8217;ry bit as good as a carpenter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be blasted if that&#8217;s got
<i>me</i> scairt any.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckshot shook his haid. &#8220;I&#8217;m right sorry t&#8217;
see any bad blood &#8217;twixt y&#8217;,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Next thing, it was all over town that Hank
was a-lookin&#8217; fer me.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I heerd that it was Hairoil tole
Macie about it. &#8220;You know,&#8221; he says to her,
&#8220;whenever Hank&#8217;s loaded and in hollerin&#8217; distance
of a town, you can shore bet some one&#8217;s
goin&#8217; t&#8217; git hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>Mace, she looked a little bit nervous. But she
just said, &#8220;I reckon Alec can take keer of hisself.&#8221;
Then off she goes to pick out a trunk at
Silverstein&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I reckon, though, that ole Silverstein &#8217;d heerd
about the trouble, too. So when Mace come back
to the eatin&#8217;-house, she sit down and writ me a
letter. &#8220;<i>Friend Alec,</i>&#8221; it said, &#8220;<i>I want to see
you fer a minute right after supper. Macie Sewell.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was four o&#8217;clock then. Supper was a good
two hours off. Say! how them two hours drug!</p>

<p>But all good things come to a&#8217; end&#8211;as the
feller said when he was strung up on a rope. And
the hands of my watch loped into they places
when they couldn&#8217;t hole back no longer. Then,
outen the door on the track side of the eatin&#8217;-house,
here she come!</p>

<p>My little gal! I was hungry t&#8217; talk to her, and
git holt of one of her hands. But whilst I watched
her walk toward me, I couldn&#8217;t move, it seemed
like; and they was a lump as big as a baseball
right where my Adam&#8217;s apple oughta be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and looked straight at me, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
seen she&#8217;d been cryin&#8217;. &#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean t&#8217; give in and see you &#8217;fore I went.
But they tole me you and Hank &#8217;d had words.
And&#8211;and I couldn&#8217;t stay mad no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, honey, thank y&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; away t&#8217; stay,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;Leastways, I don&#8217;t <i>think</i> so. But I want a try
at singin&#8217;, Alec,&#8211;a chanst. Paw&#8217;s down on me
account of that. And he don&#8217;t even come in town
no more. Wal, I&#8217;m sorry. But&#8211;<i>you</i> understand,
Alec, don&#8217;t y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, little gal. Go ahaid. I wouldn&#8217;t hole
you back. I <i>want</i> you should have a chanst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I win out, I want you t&#8217; come to Noo
York and hear me sing. Will y&#8217;, Alec?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ev&#8217;ry night, I&#8217;ll go out under the cottonwoods,
by the ditch, and I&#8217;ll say, &#8216;Gawd, bless
my little gal.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t fergit y&#8217;, Alec.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned my haid away. Off west they was
just a little melon-rind of moon in the sky. As I
looked, it begun to dance, kinda, and change
shape. &#8220;I&#8217;ll allus be waitin&#8217;,&#8221; I says, after a
little, &#8220;&#8211;if it&#8217;s five years, &#8217;r fifty, &#8217;r the end of
my life.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;They won&#8217;t never be no other man, Alec.
Just you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie!&#8221;</p>

<p>That second, we both heerd hollerin&#8217; acrosst
the street. Then here come Hairoil, runnin&#8217;, and
carryin&#8217; a gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says, pantin&#8217;, &#8220;take this.&#8221; (He
shoved the gun into my hand.) &#8220;Miss Macie,
git outen the way. It&#8217;s Hank!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quick as I could, I moved to one side, so&#8217;s
she wouldn&#8217;t be in range.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ye-e-e-oop!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As Hank rounded the corner, he was staggerin&#8217;
some, and wavin&#8217; his shootin&#8217;-iron. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a Texas bad man,&#8221; he yelps; &#8220;I&#8217;m as ba-a-ad as
they make &#8217;em, and tough as bull beef.&#8221; Then,
he went tearin&#8217; back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards like he&#8217;d
pull up the station platform. &#8220;Hey!&#8221; he goes
on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve put a <i>lot</i> of fellers t&#8217; sleep with they
boots on! Come ahaid if you want t&#8217; git planted
in my private graveyard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next, and whilst Mace was standin&#8217; not ten
feet back of him, he seen me. He spit on his pistol
hand, and started my way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You blamed polecat,&#8221; he hollered, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
learn you t&#8217; shoot off you&#8217; mouth when it ain&#8217;t
loaded! You&#8217; hands ain&#8217;t mates and you&#8217; feet
don&#8217;t track, and I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; plumb lay you
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>I just stayed where I was. &#8220;What&#8217;s in you&#8217;
craw, anyhow?&#8221; I called back.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t answer. He let fly!</p>

<p>Wal, sir, I doubled up like a jack-knife, and
went down kerflop. The boys got &#8217;round me&#8211;say!
talk about you&#8217; pale-faces!&#8211;and yelled to
Hank to stop. He drawed another gun, and, just
as I got t&#8217; my feet, went backin&#8217; off, coverin&#8217; the
crowd all the time, and warnin&#8217; &#8217;em not t&#8217; mix in.</p>

<p>They didn&#8217;t. But someone else did&#8211;Mace.
Quick as a wink, she reached into a buckboard fer
a whip. Next, she run straight up to Hank&#8211;and
give him a <i>turrible</i> lick!</p>

<p>He dropped his pistols and put his two arms
acrosst his eyes. &#8220;Mace! don&#8217;t!&#8221; he hollered.
(It&#8217;d sobered him, seemed like.) Then, he turned
and took to his heels.</p>

<p>That same second, I heerd a yell&#8211;Bergin&#8217;s
voice. Next, the sheriff come tearin&#8217; &#8217;round the
corner and tackled Hank. The two hit the
ground like a thousand of brick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>Mace come runnin&#8217; towards me, then. But the
boys haided her off, and wouldn&#8217;t let her git
clost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blood&#8217;s runnin&#8217; all down this side of him,&#8221;
says Monkey Mike.</p>

<p>Shore enough, it was!</p>

<p>&#8220;Chub!&#8221; yells Buckshot, &#8220;git Billy Trowbridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you cry, ner nothin&#8217;,&#8221; says Hairoil t&#8217;
Mace. And whilst he helt her back, they packed
me acrosst the platform and up-stairs into one of
them rooms over the lunch-counter. And then,
&#8217;fore I could say Jack Robinson, they hauled my
coat off, put a wet towel &#8217;round my forrid, and
put me into bed. After that, they pulled down
the curtains, and bunched t&#8217;gether on either side
of my pilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; I says. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right. Let me up,
you blamed fools!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, Monkey Mike come runnin&#8217; in with
the parson, and the parson put out a hand t&#8217; make
me be still. &#8220;My <i>dear</i> friend,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m
<i>sorry</i> this happened.&#8221; And he was so darned
worried lookin&#8217; that I begun t&#8217; think somethin&#8217;
shore <i>was</i> wrong with me, and I laid quiet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>Next, the door opened and in come Mace!</p>

<p>The room was so dark she couldn&#8217;t see much at
first. So, she stepped closter, walkin&#8217; soft, like
she didn&#8217;t want to jar nobody. &#8220;Alec!&#8221; she says
tearful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stooped over me.</p>

<p>The boys turned they backs.</p>

<p>Aw, my dear little gal! Her lips was cold, and
tremblin&#8217;.</p>

<p>Wal, then she turned to the bunch, speakin&#8217;
awful anxious. &#8220;Is he hurt bad?&#8221; she ast, low
like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw,&#8221; I begun, &#8220;I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Monkey Mike edged &#8217;twixt me and her, puttin&#8217;
one hand over my mouth so &#8217;s I couldn&#8217;t talk.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t know exac&#8217;ly,&#8221; he answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; she says, like she was astin&#8217; &#8217;em to
fergive her; and, &#8220;Alec!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buckshot said afterwards that it <i>shore</i> was a
solemn death-bed scene. The parson was back
agin the wall, his chin on his bosom; I was chawin&#8217;
the fingers offen Mike, and the rest of the fellers
was standin&#8217; t&#8217;gether, laughin&#8217; into they hats fit
t&#8217; sprain they faces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>Billy come in then. &#8220;Doc,&#8221; says Macie, &#8220;save
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all I can,&#8221; promises Billy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
hope he&#8217;ll pull through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, Alec!&#8221; says Mace, again.</p>

<p>Hairoil went up to her. &#8220;Mace,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;they&#8217;s one thing you can do that&#8217;d be a <i>mighty</i>
big comfort t&#8217; pore Cupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; she ast, earnest as the devil.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do <i>any</i>thin&#8217; fer him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry him, Mace,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and try to nuss
him back t&#8217; health again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was plumb amazed. &#8220;<i>Marry!</i>&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>But &#8217;fore I could git any more out, Mike shut
off my wind!</p>

<p>Dear little gal! She wasn&#8217;t skittish no more:
She was so tame she&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; et right outen my hand.
&#8220;Parson,&#8221; she says, goin&#8217; towards him, &#8220;will&#8211;will
you marry Alec and me&#8211;now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dee-lighted,&#8221; says the parson, &#8220;&#8211;if he is able
t&#8217; go through the ceremony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parson,&#8221; I begun, pullin&#8217; my face loose, &#8220;I
want<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike give me a dig.</p>

<p>I looked at him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>He wunk&#8211;<i>hard</i>.</p>

<p>And then, I tumbled!</p>

<p>Fer a minute, I just laid back, faint shore
enough, thinkin&#8217; what a all-fired sucker I was.
And whilst I was stretched out that-a-way, Mace
come clost and give me her hand. The parson, he
took out a little black book.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dearly beloved,</i>&#8221; he begun, &#8220;<i>we are gathered
t&#8217;gether<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then I sit up. &#8220;Parson, stop!&#8221; I says.
And to Mace, &#8220;Little gal, I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; let
&#8217;em take no advantage of you. I <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> hit in the
side. It&#8217;s my arm, and it&#8217;s only just creased a
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mace kinda blinked, not knowin&#8217; whether t&#8217; be
glad &#8217;r not, I reckon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this hull bsuiness,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;is a
trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her haid went up, and her cheeks got plumb
white. Then, she begun t&#8217; back&#8211;slow. &#8220;A
trick!&#8221; she repeats; &#8220;&#8211;it&#8217;s a trick! Aw, how
mean! how <i>mean!</i> I didn&#8217;t think you was like
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, Mace? It wasn&#8217;t<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A trick!&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
found it out&#8211;<i>yas</i>. This afternoon when I was
talkin&#8217; to y&#8217;, I wanted t&#8217; stay right here in Briggs&#8211;I wanted t&#8217; stay with you. If you&#8217;d just said
you wisht I would; if you&#8217;d just turned over you&#8217;
hand, why, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; give up the trip. My heart was
achin&#8217; t&#8217; think I was goin&#8217;. But now, <i>now&#8211;</i>&#8221;
And she choked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie!&#8221; I says. &#8220;Aw, don&#8217;t!&#8221; Somehow I
was beginnin&#8217; t&#8217; feel kinda dizzy and sick.</p>

<p>She faced the parson. &#8220;And you was in it,
too!&#8211;<i>you!</i>&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do anythin&#8217; t&#8217; keep you from goin&#8217; t&#8217; Noo
York,&#8221; he answers, &#8220;and from bein&#8217; a&#8217; actress.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at Billy next. &#8220;The hull <i>town</i> was
in it!&#8221; she went on. &#8220;<i>Ev&#8217;ry</i>body was ready t&#8217;
git me fooled; t&#8217; make me the josh of the
county!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>no,</i> little gal,&#8221; I answers, and got to my
feet byside the bed. &#8220;Not me, honey!&#8221;</p>

<p>She only just turned and opened the door. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t wonder the rest of you ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; t&#8217;
say,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Why, I ain&#8217;t never <i>heerd</i> of
anythin&#8217; so&#8211;so low.&#8221; And haid down, and sobbin&#8217;,
she went out.</p>

<p>I tried t&#8217; foller, but my laigs was sorta wobbley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
I got just a step &#8217;r two, and put a&#8217; arm on
Billy&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>The boys went out then, too, not sayin&#8217; a word,
but lookin&#8217; some sneaky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring her back,&#8221; I called after &#8217;em. &#8220;Aw,
I&#8217;ve hurt my pore little gal!&#8221; I started t&#8217; walk
again, leanin&#8217; on the doc. &#8220;Boys!<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Next thing, over I flopped into Billy&#8217;s arms.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>When I come to, a little later on, here was
Billy settin&#8217; byside me, a&#8217; awful sober look on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; I says to him, &#8220;where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid&#8211;don&#8217;t take it hard, ole man&#8211;she&#8217;s&#8211;she&#8217;s gone. Boarded the East-bound not half
a&#8217; hour ago. But, pardner<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Gone!</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t answer him. I just rolled over onto
my face.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Wal</span>, pore ole Sewell! <i>I</i> wasn&#8217;t feelin&#8217; dandy
them days, you&#8217;d better believe. But, Sewell, he
took Macie&#8217;s goin&#8217; <i>turrible</i> bad. Whenever he
come in town, he was allus just as <i>qui-i-et</i>.
Not a cheep about the little gal; wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
laughed fer a nickel; and never&#8217;d go anywheres
nigh the lunch-counter. Then, he begun t&#8217; git
peakeder&#8217;n the dickens, and his eyes looked as big
as saucers, and bloodshot. Pore ole boss!</p>

<p>I kept outen his way. He&#8217;d heerd all about
that Shackleton business, y&#8217; savvy, and was awful
down on me; helt me <i>re</i>sponsible fer the hull
thing, and tole the boys he never wanted t&#8217; set
eyes on me again. Hairoil went to him and said
I&#8217;d been jobbed, and was innocenter&#8217;n Mary&#8217;s
little lamb. But Sewell wouldn&#8217;t listen even, and
said I&#8217;d done him dirt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>A-course, I couldn&#8217;t go back t&#8217; my Bar Y
job, then,&#8211;and me plumb crazy t&#8217; git to work
and make enough t&#8217; go to Noo York on! But I
didn&#8217;t do no mournin&#8217;; I kept a stiff upper lip.
&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;allus remember
that the gal that&#8217;s hard t&#8217; ketch is the best kind
when oncet you&#8217;ve got her.&#8221; And I sit down and
writ the foreman of the Mulhall outfit. (By
now, my arm was all healed up fine.)</p>

<p>Wal, when I went over to the post-office a little
bit later on, the post-master tole me that Sewell&#8217;d
just got a letter from Macie!&#8211;but it hadn&#8217;t
seemed t&#8217; chirp the ole man up any. And they
was one fer Mrs. Trowbridge, too, he says; did
I want to look at it?</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; I answers.</p>

<p>It was from her&#8211;I&#8217;d know her little dinky l&#8217;s
<i>anywheres</i>. I helt it fer a minute&#8211;&#8217;twixt my
two hands. It was like I had her fingers, kinda.
Then, &#8220;S&#8217;pose they ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; fer me t&#8217;day,&#8221;
I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cupid,&#8211;sorry. Next time, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I goes on &#8220;would you mind lettin&#8217; me
take this over t&#8217; Rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8211;go ahaid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>I went, quick as ever my laigs could carry me,
the letter tucked inside my shirt.</p>

<p>Rose read it out loud t&#8217; me, whilst I helt the
kid. It wasn&#8217;t a long letter, but, somehow, I never
could recollect afterwards just the exac&#8217; words
that was in it. I drawed, though, that Mace was
havin&#8217; a <i>way</i>-up time. She was seein&#8217; all the
shows, she said, meetin&#8217; slathers of folks, and had
a room with a nice, sorta middle-aged lady, in a
place where a lot of young fellers and gals hung
out t&#8217; study all kinds of fool business. Some of
&#8217;em she liked, and some she didn&#8217;t. Some took
her fer a greeney, and some was fresh. But she
was learnin&#8217; a pile&#8211;and &#8217;d heerd Susy&#8217;s Band!</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; I ast when Rose was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, Cupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she give her <i>ad</i>dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just Gen&#8217;ral Deliv&#8217;ry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217;, Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay t&#8217; dinner, Cupid. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; have
chicken fricassee.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t feel like eatin&#8217;. I put the kid
down and come away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>I made towards Dutchy&#8217;s&#8211;pretty blue, I was,
a-course. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; I says, &#8220;bad luck runs in
you&#8217; fambly like the wooden laig.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, mind y&#8217;, I wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; with the idear of
boozin&#8217; up, <i>no,</i> ma&#8217;am. <i>I</i> figger that if a gal&#8217;s
worth stewin&#8217; over any, she&#8217;s a hull lot <i>too</i> good
fer a man that gits <i>drunk</i>. I went &#8217;cause I
knowed the boys was there; and them days the
boys was <i>mighty</i> nice to me.</p>

<p>Wal, this day, I&#8217;m powerful glad I went. If
I hadn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;d never &#8217;a&#8217; got that bully <i>po</i>-sition,
&#8217;r played Cupid again (without knowin&#8217;
it)&#8211;and so got the one chanst I was a-prayin&#8217;
fer.</p>

<p>Now, this is what happened:</p>

<p>I&#8217;d just got inside Dutchy&#8217;s, and was a-standin&#8217;
behind Buckshot Milliken, watchin&#8217; him bluff
the station-agent with two little pair, when I
heerd Hairoil a-talkin&#8217; to hisself, kinda. &#8220;Dear
me suz!&#8221; he says (he was peerin&#8217; acrosst the street
towards the deepot), &#8220;what blamed funny things
I see when I ain&#8217;t got no gun!&#8221;</p>

<p>A-course, we all stampeded over and took a
squint. &#8220;Wal, when did <i>that</i> blow in?&#8221; says Bill
Rawson. And, &#8220;Say! ketch me whilst I faint!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
goes on one of the Lazy X boys, making believe
as if he was weak in the laigs. The rest of just
haw-hawed.</p>

<p>A young feller we&#8217;d never seen afore was
comin&#8217; cater-corners from the station. He was
a slim-Jim, sorta salla complected, jaw clean
scraped, and he had on a pair of them tony pinchbug
spectacles. He was rigged out fit t&#8217; kill&#8211;grey
store clothes, dicer same colour as the suit,
sky-blue shirt, socks tatooed green, and gloves.
He passed clost, not lookin&#8217; our <i>di</i>rection, and
made fer the Arnaz rest&#8217;rant.</p>

<p>Just as he got right in front of it, he come short
and begun readin&#8217; the sign that&#8217;s over the door&#8211;</p>

<div class='center'>
<p><i>Meals 25c<br />
Start in and It&#8217;s a Habit<br />
You cain&#8217;t Quit.</i></p>
</div> <!-- centered -->

<p>Then we seen him grin like he was <i>turrible</i>
tickled, and take out a piece of paper t&#8217; set somethin&#8217;
down. Next, in he slides.</p>

<p>We all dropped back and lined up again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a sewin&#8217;-machine agent, &#8217;r he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; wore
a duster,&#8221; says Hairoil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;And a patent medicine man would &#8217;a&#8217; had on
a stove-pipe,&#8221; adds Bergin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maype he iss a preacher,&#8221; puts in Dutchy,
lookin&#8217; scairt as the dickens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nixey,&#8221; I says. &#8220;But if he was a drummer,
he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; steered straight fer a thirst-parlour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Missed it a mile&#8211;the hull of us. Minute, and
in run Sam Barnes, face redder&#8217;n a danger-signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he says, all up in the air, &#8220;did y&#8217;
see It? Wal, what d&#8217; you think? It&#8217;s from Boston,
and It writes. I was at the Arnaz feed shop,
gassin&#8217; Carlota, when It shassayed in. Said It
was down here fer the first time in a-a-all Its
life, and figgers t&#8217; work this town fer book mawterial.
Gents, It&#8217;s a liter&#8217;toor sharp!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the <i>gall!</i>&#8221; growls Chub Flannagan,
gittin&#8217; hot. &#8220;Goin&#8217; t&#8217; take a shy outen us!&#8221; And
I seen that some of the other boys felt like <i>he</i>
did.</p>

<p>Buckshot Milliken spit in his hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
over,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and just natu&#8217;lly settle that
dude&#8217;s hash. I&#8217;d <i>admire</i> t&#8217; do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I haided him off quick. Then I faced the
bunch. &#8220;Gents,&#8221; I begun, &#8220;ain&#8217;t you just a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
bit hasty? Now, don&#8217;t git in a sweat. <i>Con</i>-sider
this subject a little &#8217;fore you act. Sam, I
thought you <i>liked</i> t&#8217; read liter&#8217;toor books.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam hauled out &#8220;Stealthy Steve&#8221;&#8211;a fav&#8217;-rite
of hisn. &#8220;Shore I do,&#8221; he answers. &#8220;But, as
I tole this Boston feller, no liter&#8217;toor&#8217;s been happenin&#8217;
in Briggs lately&#8211;no killin&#8217;s, &#8217;r train hole-ups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> right, Sam,&#8221; I says, sarcastic; &#8220;go
and switch him over t&#8217; Goldstone,&#8211;when they
won&#8217;t be another book writer stray down this way
fer a coon&#8217;s age. Say! You got a haid like a
tack!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam dried up. I come back at the boys.
&#8220;Gents,&#8221; I <i>con</i>tinues, &#8220;don&#8217;t you see this is
Briggs City&#8217;s one big chanst?&#8211;the chanst t&#8217; git
put in red letters on the railroad maps! T&#8217; git
five square mile of this mesquite staked out into
town lots! You all know how we&#8217;ve had t&#8217; take
the slack of them jay-hawk farmers over Cestos
way; and they ain&#8217;t such a <i>much,</i> and cain&#8217;t raise
nothin&#8217; but shin-oak and peanuts and chiggers.
But they tell how <i>we</i> git all the cyclones and rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll curl they hair. Listen, gents,&#8211;Oklahomaw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
City&#8217;s got element streets, Guthrie&#8217;s
got a Carniggie lib&#8217;rary, and Bliss&#8217;s got the
Hunderd-One Ranch. <i>And we&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; cabbage
this book!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that&#8217;s a hoss of another colour,&#8221; admits
Chub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; says Buckshot, &#8220;Cupid&#8217;s right. We
certainly got to attend to this visitor that&#8217;s come
to our enterprisin&#8217; city, and give him a fair
shake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>But,</i>&#8221; puts in Sam, &#8220;we&#8217;re up a tree. Where&#8217;s
his mawterial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mawterial,&#8221; I says, &#8220;&#8211;I don&#8217;t just savvy
what he means by that. But, boys, whatever it
is, we got t&#8217; see that he <i>gits</i> it. Now, s&#8217;posin&#8217; I
go find him, and sorta feel &#8217;round a little, and
draw him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>They was agreed, and I split fer the rest&#8217;rant.
Boston was there, all right, talkin&#8217; to ole lady
Arnaz (but keepin&#8217; a&#8217; eye peeled towards Carlota),
and pickin&#8217; the shucks offen a tamale. I
sit down and ast fer flapjacks. And whilst I was
waitin&#8217; I sized him up.</p>

<p>Clost to, I liked his looks. And from the jump,
I seen one thing&#8211;they wasn&#8217;t <i>no</i> showin&#8217; off to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
him, and no extra dawg (&#8217;r he wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; come
to a joint where meals is only two-bits). He was
a book-writer, but when he talked he didn&#8217;t use
no ten-dollar-a-dozen words. And, in place of
seegars, he smoked cigareets&#8211;and rolled &#8217;em hisself
with <i>one</i> hand, by jingo!</p>

<p>Wal, we had a nice, long parley-voo, me gittin&#8217;
the hull sittywaytion as <i>re</i>gards his book, and
tellin&#8217; him we&#8217;d shore lay ourselves out t&#8217; help
him&#8211;if we didn&#8217;t, it wouldn&#8217;t be white; him, settin&#8217;
down things ev&#8217;ry oncet in a while, &#8217;r whittlin&#8217;
a stick with one of them self-cockin&#8217; jackknives.</p>

<p>We chinned fer the best part of a&#8217; hour. Then,
he made me a proposition. This was it: &#8220;Mister
Lloyd,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I&#8217;d like t&#8217; have you with me
all the time I&#8217;m down here,&#8211;that&#8217;ll be three
weeks, anyhow. You could <i>ex</i>plain things, and&#8211;and
be a kinda bodyguard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my friend,&#8221; I says, &#8220;<i>you</i> don&#8217;t need
no bodyguard in Oklahomaw. But I&#8217;ll be glad t&#8217;
<i>ex</i>plain anythin&#8217; I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course, I want t&#8217; pay you,&#8221; he goes on;
&#8220;&#8217;cause I&#8217;d be takin&#8217; you&#8217; time<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take no pay,&#8221; I breaks in. &#8220;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
if I was t&#8217; have to go, why any one of the bunch
could help you just as good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk business,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I like you,
and I don&#8217;t <i>want</i> you t&#8217; go. Now, what&#8217;s you&#8217;
time worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I git forty a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that suits me. And you&#8217; job won&#8217;t be
a hard one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, then, we shook hands. But, a-course, I
didn&#8217;t swaller that bodyguard story,&#8211;I figgered
that what he wanted was t&#8217; git in with the boys
through me.</p>

<p>Wal, when I got back t&#8217; the thirst-parlour, I
acted like I was loco. &#8220;Boys! boys! <i>boys!</i>&#8221; I hollered,
&#8220;I got a job!&#8221; And I give &#8217;em all a whack
on the back, and I done a jig.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I was calmer. Then, I says, &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; ride fer Mulhall,&#8211;not <i>this</i> month,
anyhow. This liter&#8217;toor gent&#8217;s hired me as his
book foreman. As I understand it, they&#8217;s some
things he wants, and I&#8217;m to help corral &#8217;em. He
says that just now most folks seem t&#8217; be takin&#8217; a
lot of interest in the West. He don&#8217;t reckon the
fashion&#8217;ll keep up, but, a-course a book-writer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
has t&#8217; git on to the band-wagon. So, it&#8217;s up t&#8217; me,
boys, to give him what&#8217;s got to be had &#8217;fore the
<i>ex</i>citement dies down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil come over t&#8217; me. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;the hull kit and boodle of us&#8217;ll come in on this.
We want t&#8217; help, that&#8217;s the reason. We <i>owe</i> it to
y&#8217;, Cupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;I appreciate what you
mean, and I <i>ac</i>cept you&#8217; offer. Thank y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this feller want?&#8221; ast Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;he spoke a good bit about
colour<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s shore colour at the Arnaz feed shop,&#8221;
puts in Monkey Mike; &#8220;&#8211;them strings of red
peppers that the ole lady keeps hung on the walls.
And we can git blue shirts over to Silverstein&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mike,&#8221; I says, &#8220;that ain&#8217;t the idear. Colour
is <i>Briggs,</i> and <i>us.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, punk!&#8221; says Sam. &#8220;What kind of a
book is it goin&#8217; t&#8217; be, anyhow, with us punchers
in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you hear what I got t&#8217; <i>do,</i>&#8221; I answers.
&#8220;To <i>con</i>tinue: He mentioned char<i>ac</i>ters.
Course, I had to <i>ad</i>mit we&#8217;re kinda shy on <i>them.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wisht we had a few Injuns,&#8221; says Hairoil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
&#8220;A scalpin&#8217; makes <i>mighty</i> fine readin&#8217;. Now,
mebbe, &#8217;Pache Sam&#8217;d pass,&#8211;if he was lickered up
proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny,&#8221; I says, &#8220;but he didn&#8217;t bring up Injuns.
Reckon they ain&#8217;t stylish no more. But he
put it plain that he&#8217;d got to have a bad man.
Said in a Western book you <i>allus</i> got t&#8217; have a
bad man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since we strung up them two Foster boys.&#8221;
says Bergin, &#8220;Briggs ain&#8217;t had what you&#8217;d call a
bad man. In view of this writin&#8217; feller comin&#8217;, I
don&#8217;t know, gents, but what we was a little <i>hasty</i>
in the Foster matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;we got t&#8217; do our best with
what&#8217;s left. This findin&#8217; mawterial fer a book
ain&#8217;t no dead open-and-shut proposition. &#8217;Cause
Briggs ain&#8217;t big, and it ain&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call bad.
That&#8217;ll hole us back. But let&#8217;s dig in and make
up fer what&#8217;s lackin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, we rustled &#8217;round. First off, we togged
ourselves out the way punchers allus look in magazines.
(I knowed that was how he wanted us.)
We rounded up all the shaps in town, with orders
to wear &#8217;em constant&#8211;and made Dutchy keep
&#8217;em on, too! Then, guns: Each of us carried six,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
kinda like a front fringe, y&#8217; savvy. Next, one of
the boys loped out t&#8217; the Lazy X and brung in a
young college feller that&#8217;d come t&#8217; Oklahomaw a
while back fer his health. It &#8217;pears that he&#8217;d
been readin&#8217; a Western book that was writ by a&#8217;
Eastern gent somewheres in Noo Jersey. And,
say! he was the wildest lookin&#8217; cow-punch that&#8217;s
ever been saw in these parts!</p>

<p>We&#8217;d no more&#8217;n got all fixed up nice when,
&#8220;Ssh!&#8221; says Buckshot, &#8220;here he comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, boys!&#8221; I says, &#8220;we got t&#8217; sing. It&#8217;s
expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sheriff, he struck up<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p class='i'>&#8220;Paddy went to the Chinaman with only one shirt.</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s tough!</i>&#8221; we hollers, loud enough to lift the shakes.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p class='i'>&#8220;He lost of his ticket, says, &#8216;Divvil the worse&#8217;,</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s tough!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mister Boston stopped byside the door. The
sheriff goes on<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p class='i'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>&#8220;Aw, Pat fer his shirt, he begged hard and plead,</p>
<p class='i'>But, &#8216;No tickee, no washee&#8217;, the Chinaman said.</p>
<p class='i'>Now Paddy&#8217;s in jail, and the Chinaman&#8217;s dead!</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s tough!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It brung him. He looked in, kinda edged
through the door, took a bench, and <i>sur</i>veyed
them shaps, and them guns till his eyes plumb
<i>pro</i>truded. &#8220;Rippin&#8217;!&#8221; I heerd him say.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That's tough,&#8217;&#8221; repeats Monkey Mike,
winkin&#8217; to the boys. &#8220;Wal, I should <i>re</i>mark it
was!&#8211;to go t&#8217; jail just fer pluggin&#8217; a Chink.
Irish must &#8217;a&#8217; felt like two-bits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston lent over towards me. &#8220;What&#8217;s two
bits?&#8221; he ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s two bits,&#8221; says Rawson. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
know? Wal, <i>one</i> bit is what you can take outen
the other feller&#8217;s hide at one mouthful. <i>Two</i> bits,
a-course, is two of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; says that college feller from the Lazy
X, &#8220;go fer the cheek allus&#8211;the best eatin&#8217;.&#8221; (He
was smart, all right.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>&#8220;Not a Chinaman&#8217;s cheek&#8211;too tough,&#8221; says
the sheriff.</p>

<p>Boston begun to kinda talk to hisself. &#8220;Horrible!&#8221;
he says. &#8220;Shy Locks, by Heaven!&#8221; Then
to me again, speakin&#8217; low and pointin&#8217; at the
sheriff, &#8220;Mister Lloyd, what kind of a fambly
did that man come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know a hull lot about him,&#8221; I answers,
&#8220;but his mother was a squaw, and his father was
found on a doorstep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>squaw,</i>&#8221; he says. &#8220;That accounts fer it.&#8221;
And he begun to watch the sheriff clost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gents, what you want fer you&#8217; supper?&#8221; ast
the Arnaz boy, comin&#8217; our <i>di</i>rection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel awful caved in,&#8221; answers Buckshot.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a dozen aigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll you have &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boil &#8217;em hard, so&#8217;s I can hole &#8217;em in my
fingers. And say, cool &#8217;em off &#8217;fore you dish &#8217;em
up. I got blistered <i>bad</i> the last time I et aigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rawson, what&#8217;ll <i>you</i> have?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rawson, he kinda cocked one ear. &#8220;Wal,&#8221; he
says, easy like, &#8220;give me rattlesnake on toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody cheeped fer a minute, &#8217;cause the boys
was stumped fer somethin&#8217; to go on with. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
just as I was gittin&#8217; nervous that the conversation
was peterin&#8217; out, Boston speaks up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rattlesnake?&#8221; he says; &#8220;did he say <i>rattlesnake?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a shot, Rawson turned towards him,
wrinklin&#8217; his forrid and wigglin&#8217; his moustache
awful fierce. &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> what I said,&#8221; he answers,
voice plumb down to his number &#8217;levens.</p>

<p>It give me my show. I drug Boston away.
&#8220;Gee!&#8221; I says, &#8220;on <i>this</i> side of the Mississippi,
you got to be <i>keerful</i> how you go shoot off you&#8217;
mouth! And when you <i>re</i>mark on folks&#8217;s eatin&#8217;,
you don&#8217;t want t&#8217; look tickled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, that was all the colour he got till night,
when I had somethin&#8217; more <i>pre</i>pared. We took
up a collection fer winda-glass, and Chub Flannagan,
who can roll a gun the <i>prettiest</i> you ever
seen, walked up and down nigh Boston&#8217;s stoppin&#8217;-place,
invitin&#8217; the fellers t&#8217; come out and
&#8220;git et up,&#8221; makin&#8217; one &#8217;r two of us dance the
heel-and-toe when we showed ourselves, and
shootin&#8217; up the town gen&#8217;ally.</p>

<p>Then, fer a week, nothin&#8217; happened.</p>

<p>It was just about then that Rose got another
letter from Macie. And it seemed t&#8217; me that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
little gal &#8217;d changed her tune some. She said
Noo York took a <i>turrible</i> lot of money&#8211;clothes,
and grub, and so forth and so on. Said they was
so blamed little oxygen in the town that a lamp
wouldn&#8217;t burn, and they&#8217;d got to use &#8217;lectricity.
And&#8211;that was all fer <i>this</i> time, &#8217;cause she had t&#8217;
write her paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; I says to Rose, &#8220;that it&#8217;d be wastin&#8217;
my breath t&#8217; ast<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, Cupid,&#8221; she answers, &#8220;but it&#8217;ll be O.
K. when she sees you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> reckon,&#8221; I says hopeful. And I hunted up
my new boss.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t give me such a lot t&#8217; do them days&#8211;except
t&#8217; show up at the feed-shop three times
reg&#8217;lar. That struck me as kinda funny&#8211;&#8217;cause
he was as flush as a&#8217; Osage chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you grub over to the eatin&#8217;-house
oncet in a while?&#8221; I ast him. &#8220;They got all <i>kinds</i>
of tony things&#8211;tomatoes and cucumbers and as-paragrass,
and them little toadstool things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And out here in the desert!&#8221; says Boston.
&#8220;I s&#8217;pose they bring &#8217;em from other places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on you&#8217; life!&#8221; I answers. &#8220;They grow
&#8217;em right here&#8211;in flower pots.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>Out come a pencil. &#8220;How pictureskew!&#8221; Boston
says,&#8211;and put it down.</p>

<p>End of that first week, when I stopped in at
the Arnaz place fer supper, I says to him, &#8220;Wal,&#8221;
I says, &#8220;book about done?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was layin&#8217; back lazy in a chair,&#8211;<i>as</i> usual&#8211;watchin&#8217; Carlota trot the crock&#8217;ry in. He batted
his eyes. &#8220;Done!&#8221; he repeats. &#8220;<i>No</i>. Why,
I ain&#8217;t got only a few notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Notes?&#8221; I says; &#8220;notes?&#8221; I was <i>turrible</i>
disappointed. (I reckon I was worryin&#8217; over the
book worse&#8217;n <i>he</i> was.) &#8220;Why, say, couldn&#8217;t you
make nothin&#8217; outen that bad man who was
a-paintin&#8217; the town the other night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a bad man don&#8217;t make a book,&#8221; says
Boston; &#8220;leastways, only a yalla-back. But take
a bad man, and a <i>gal,</i> and you git a story of <i>ad</i>-venture.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gal. Yas, you need a gal fer a book. And
you need <i>the</i> gal if you want t&#8217; be right happy. I
knowed that. Pretty soon, I ast, &#8220;Have you
picked on a gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Carlota,&#8221; he says. &#8220;<i>She&#8217;d</i> make a
figger fer a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlota!&#8211;the little skeezicks! Y&#8217; see, she&#8217;s <i>aw-ful</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
pretty. Hair blacker&#8217;n a stack of black cats.
Black eyes, too,&#8211;big and friendly lookin&#8217;.
(That&#8217;s where you git fooled&#8211;Carlota&#8217;s a blend
of tiger-cat and bronc; she can purr &#8217;r pitch&#8211;take
you&#8217; choice.) Her face is just snow white,
with a little bit of pink&#8211;now y&#8217; see it, now y&#8217;
don&#8217;t see it&#8211;on her cheeks, and a little spot of
blazin&#8217; red fer a mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what I&#8217;m after most now,&#8221; he goes on,
&#8220;is a plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>A plot, y&#8217; savvy, is a story, and I got him
the best I could find. This was Buckshot&#8217;s:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boston, this is a <i>blamed</i> enterprisin&#8217; country,&#8211;almost <i>any</i> ole thing can happen out here. Did
you ever hear tell how Nick Erickson got his
stone fence? No? You could put <i>that</i> in a book.
Wal, you know, Erickson lives east of here. Nice
hunderd and sixty acres he&#8217;s got&#8211;level, no
stones. Wanted t&#8217; fence it. Couldn&#8217;t buy lumber
&#8217;r wire. Figgered on haulin&#8217; stone, only stone was
so blamed far t&#8217; haul. Then,&#8211;Nature was accommodatin&#8217;.
Come a&#8217; earthquake that shook and
shook the ranch. Shook all the stones to the
top. Erickson picked &#8217;em up&#8211;and built the
fence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>But Boston was hard t&#8217; satisfy. So I tried to
tell him about Rose and Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he says; &#8220;if they&#8217;s <i>one</i> thing them
printin&#8217; fellers won&#8217;t stand fer it&#8217;s a hero<i>ine</i> that&#8217;s
hitched.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, then, I branched off on to pore Bud
Hickok.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Boston, again; &#8220;<i>that</i> won&#8217;t do.
It&#8217;s got to end up happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, it looked as if that book was goin&#8217; fluey.
To make things worse, the boys begun kickin&#8217;
about havin&#8217; t&#8217; pack so many guns. And I had
to git up a notice, signed by the sheriff, which
said that more&#8217;n two shootin&#8217;-irons on any one
man wouldn&#8217;t be &#8217;lowed no more, and that cityzens
was t&#8217; &#8220;shed forthwith.&#8221;</p>

<p>I seen somethin&#8217; had got t&#8217; be done pronto.
&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;you <i>must con</i>sider
that there book of Boston&#8217;s some more. &#8217;Pears
that Boston ain&#8217;t gittin&#8217; all he come after. Nothin&#8217;
ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217; that he can put into a book.
Wal, it&#8217;s <i>got</i> t&#8217; happen. Just chaw on <i>that.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Next, I hunted up the boys. &#8220;Gents,&#8221; I says
to &#8217;em, &#8220;help me find a bad man that&#8217;ll fit into a
story with a gal.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>&#8220;Gal?&#8221; they repeats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas; every book has got t&#8217; have a gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; says Rawson. &#8220;Just like ev&#8217;ry herd
had got t&#8217; have a case of staggers. But&#8211;who&#8217;s
the gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys all lent towards me, fly-traps wide
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlota Arnaz,&#8221; I answers.</p>

<p>Some looked plumb eased in they minds&#8211;and
some didn&#8217;t. Carlota, she&#8217;s ace-high with quite a
bunch&#8211;all ready t&#8217; snub her up and marry her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Senorita&#8217;ll do,&#8221; says Rawson. &#8220;She
gen&#8217;ally makes out t&#8217; keep <i>some</i> man mis&#8217;rable.&#8221;</p>

<p>And fer the bad man, we picked out Pedro
Garcia, the cholo that was mixed up in that mete&#8217;rite
business. Drunk &#8217;r sober, fer a hard-looker
Pedro shore fills the bill.</p>

<p>Next, we hunted ev&#8217;ry which way fer a plot.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell y&#8217;,&#8221; says Californy Jim, that ole prospector
that hangs &#8217;round here; &#8220;if the lit&#8217;rary
lead has pinched out, why don&#8217;t you <i>salt</i>&#8211;<i>and
pretend to make a strike?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Hairoil pricked up his ears. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that
be somethin&#8217; like a&#8211;a scheme?&#8221; he ast; &#8220;somethin&#8217;
like that we planned out fer Cupid here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;Yas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hull bunch got plumb pale. Then they
made fer the door.,</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, boys!&#8221; I hollered. &#8220;<i>Hole</i> on! Remember
this is a scheme that&#8217;s been <i>ast</i> fer.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; I says, &#8220;it looks pretty good t&#8217; <i>me.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned back&#8211;shakin&#8217; they haids, though.
&#8220;Just as you say, Cupid,&#8221; says Rawson. And,
&#8220;Long&#8217;s it&#8217;s fer <i>you,</i>&#8221; adds the sheriff. &#8220;But
schemes is some dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell y&#8217;!&#8221; begins Sam Barnes. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hole
up the dust wagon from the Little Rattlesnake
Mine, all of us got up like Jesse James!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill Rawson jumped nigh four feet. &#8220;You
go soak you&#8217; haid!&#8221; he begun, mad&#8217;s a hornet.
&#8220;Hole up the dust wagon! And whichever of us
mule-skinners happens t&#8217; be bringin&#8217; it in&#8217;ll git
the G. B. from that high-falutin&#8217; gent in the
States that owns the shootin&#8217;-match. No, <i>ma&#8217;am!</i>
And if <i>that&#8217;s</i> the kind of plot you-all &#8217;re hankerin&#8217;
after, you can just count me <i>outen</i> this hawg-tyin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8211;sic &#8217;em, Towser; git t&#8217; fightin&#8217;,&#8221;
I says. &#8220;Now, Bill, <i>work</i> you&#8217; hole-back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
straps. I cain&#8217;t say as Sam&#8217;s plan hit the right
spot with me, neither. &#8217;Cause how could <i>Carlota</i>
figger in that pow-wow? Won&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, after some more pullin&#8217; and haulin&#8217;, we
fixed it up this way: Pedro&#8217;d grab Carlota and
take her away on a hoss whilst Boston and the
passel of us was in the Arnaz place. He was t&#8217;
hike north, and drop her at the Johnson shack
on the edge of town&#8211;then go on, takin&#8217; a dummy
in her place, and totin&#8217; a brace of guns filled with
blanks. We&#8217;d foller with plenty of blanks, too&#8211;and
Boston. How&#8217;s that fer high!</p>

<p>If you want to ast me, I think the hull idear
was just <i>O. K.,</i> and no mistake. Beautiful gal
kidnapped&#8211;bra-a-ave posse of punchers&#8211;hard
ride&#8211;hot fight&#8211;rescue of a pilla stuffed with
the best alfalfa on the market. <i>Pro</i>cession files
back, all sand and smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I says to Bergin, &#8220;them Eastern
printin&#8217; fellers&#8217;ll set &#8217;em up fer Boston so fast
that he&#8217;ll plumb float.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the sheriff agreed.</p>

<p>But it couldn&#8217;t happen straight off. Pedro had
t&#8217; be tole about it, and give his orders. Carlota,
the same. I managed this part of the shindig,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
the boys gittin&#8217; the blanks, the hosses and the hay
lady.</p>

<p>Wal, I rode down to the section-house and ast
fer Pedro. He come out, about ten pounds of
railroad ballast&#8211;more &#8217;r less&#8211;spread on to them
features of hisn. (<i>That</i>&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been colour fer Boston,
all right.) I tole him what we was goin&#8217; t&#8217;
do, <i>why</i> we was a-doin&#8217; it, and laid out <i>his</i> share
of the job. Then I tacked on that the gal he&#8217;d
steal was Carlota.</p>

<p>Now, as I think about it, I <i>re</i>call that he looked
<i>mighty</i> tickled. Grinned all over and said, &#8220;Me
gusta mucho&#8221; more&#8217;n a dozen times. But <i>then</i>
I didn&#8217;t pay no &#8217;tention to how he acted. I was
so glad he&#8217;d fall in with me. (The Ole Nick take
the greasers! A&#8217; out-and-out, low-down lot of
sneakin&#8217; coyotes, anyhow! And I might &#8217;a&#8217;
<i>knowed</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>)</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; I says, &#8220;they&#8217;s no rush about this.
We&#8217;ll kinda work it up slow. T&#8217; make the hull
thing seem dead real, you come to town ev&#8217;ry
evenin&#8217; fer a while, and hang &#8217;round the rest&#8217;rant.
Spend a little spondulix with the ole woman so&#8217;s
she won&#8217;t kick you out, and shine up t&#8217; Carlota
when Boston&#8217;s on the premises. Ketch on?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>Pedro said he did, and I loped back to town t&#8217;
meet up with Carlota and have it out with her&#8211;and
that was a job fer a caution!</p>

<p>Carlota was all bronc that day&#8211;stubborn,
pawin&#8217;, and takin&#8217; the bit. And if I kept up with
her, and come out in the lead, it was &#8217;cause I&#8217;d
had some <i>ex</i>perience with Macie, and I&#8217;d learned
when t&#8217; leave a rambunctious young lady have
her haid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlota,&#8221; I says, &#8220;us fellers has fixed up a
mighty nice scheme t&#8217; help out Boston with that
book he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; She was all awake&#8211;quicker&#8217;n scat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;Y&#8217; know, he&#8217;s been
wantin&#8217; somethin&#8217; <i>ex</i>citin&#8217; t&#8217; put in it. We figger
t&#8217; give it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Como?&#8221; she ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a case of kidnappin&#8217;. Man steals gal&#8211;we foller with Boston&#8211;lots of shootin&#8217;&#8211;save
the gal<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big honour&#8211;and we choosed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-o-o!&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! that hit her right, <i>I</i> tell y&#8217;! But I had to
go put my foot in it, a-course. &#8220;Yas, <i>you,</i>&#8221; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
goes on. &#8220;Mebbe you noticed Boston&#8217;s here
pretty frequent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Si! si! si! seor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8217;cause he&#8217;s been studyin&#8217; you&#8211;so&#8217;s he
could use you fer a book char<i>ac</i>ter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; she said. &#8220;<i>That</i> is it! <i>that</i> is why!&#8221;
Mad? Golly! Them black eyes of hern just
snapped, and she grabbed a hunk of bread and
begun knifin&#8217; it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem t&#8217; ketch on to
the fact that you been handed out a blamed big
compliment. A person in a <i>book</i> is <i>some potatoes.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! <i>no!</i> seor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pride hurt, I says to myself. &#8220;Now, Carlota,&#8221;
I begun, &#8220;don&#8217;t cut off you&#8217; nose t&#8217; spite
you&#8217; face. Pedro Garcia is turrible tickled that
we ast <i>him.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro&#8211;puf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the book,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;he&#8217;s the bad man
that loves you so much he cain&#8217;t help stealin&#8217;
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> Pedro,&#8221; she says. &#8220;He is like that&#8211;bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we ain&#8217;t astin&#8217; you t&#8217; <i>like</i> him, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
don&#8217;t <i>git</i> you. He drops you off at Johnson&#8217;s
and takes a dummy the rest of the way. We
want t&#8217; make Boston <i>think</i> they&#8217;s danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; All of a suddent, she didn&#8217;t seem nigh
as mad&#8211;and she looked like she&#8217;d just thought
of somethin&#8217;.</p>

<p>I seen my chanst. &#8220;That was the way we
fixed it up,&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;A-course, now you
don&#8217;t want t&#8217; be the hero<i>ine,</i> I&#8217;ll ast one of the
eatin&#8217;-house gals. I reckon <i>they</i> won&#8217;t turn me
down.&#8221; And I moseyed towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221; she calls, &#8220;come back. You say, he
will think another man loves me so much that he
carries me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got it,&#8221; I answers.</p>

<p>She showed them little nippers of hern.
&#8220;Good!&#8221; she says. &#8220;I do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Carlota, listen. Boston ain&#8217;t to be next
that this is a put-up job. He&#8217;s to think it&#8217;s genuwine.
Savvy? And he&#8217;ll git all the feelin&#8217;s of a
real kidnap. Now, to fool him right, you got to
do one thing: Be nice t&#8217; Pedro when Boston&#8217;s
&#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little nippers again. &#8220;I do it,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>I started t&#8217; go, but she called me back. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
will think another man loves me so much that he
carries me away?&#8221; she repeats.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Shore,</i>&#8221; I says. And she let me go.</p>

<p>Y&#8217; know, <i>flirtin&#8217;</i> was Carlota&#8217;s strong suit.
And that very evenin&#8217; I seen her talkin&#8217; acrosst
the counter to Pedro sweeter&#8217;n panocha,&#8211;with
a takin&#8217; smile on the south end of that cute little
face of hern. But her <i>eyes</i> wasn&#8217;t smilin&#8217;&#8211;and a
Spanish gal&#8217;s eyes don&#8217;t lie.</p>

<p>But supper was late, and Boston and me was
at a table clost by,&#8211;him lookin&#8217; ugly tempered.
So ole lady Arnaz tole Carlota t&#8217; jar loose. And
pretty soon we was wrastlin&#8217; our corn-beef, and
Pedro was gone.</p>

<p>Rawson sit down nigh us. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says
solemn, &#8220;reckon we won&#8217;t git to play that game
of draw t&#8217;-night.&#8221; And he give my foot a
kick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Account of Pedro bein&#8217; in town. I figger t&#8217;
stay clost to the bunk-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So &#8217;ll <i>I</i>,&#8221; I says, and begun examinin&#8217; my
shootin&#8217;-iron mighty anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this Pedro?&#8221; ast Boston.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t y&#8217; see him?&#8221; I says. &#8220;He&#8217;s a greaser,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
and a&#8217; awful bad cuss t&#8217; monkey with. If you
happen t&#8217; go past him and so much as wiggle a
finger, it&#8217;s like takin&#8217; you&#8217; life in you&#8217; hands.
Look at this.&#8221; And I showed him a piece that
me and Hairoil &#8217;d fixed up fer the last <i>EyeOpener</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pedro Garcia,</i>&#8221; it read, &#8220;<i>was found not
guilty by Judge Freeman fer perforatin&#8217; Nick
Trotmann&#8217;s sombrero in a street row last Saturday
night week. Proved that Nick got into Pedro&#8217;s
way and sassed him. Pedro &#8217;d come to town
consider&#8217;ble the worse fer booze and, as is allus
the case</i>&#8211;&#8221; Then they was a inch &#8217;r two without
no writin&#8217;. Under that was this: &#8220;<i>As a matter
of extreme precaution, we have lifted the last half
of the above article, havin&#8217; got word that Garcia
is due in town again. Subscribers will please excuse
the gap. I didn&#8217;t git no time t&#8217; fill it in.
Editor.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s he doin&#8217; in <i>here?</i>&#8221; says Boston,
&#8220;&#8211;talkin&#8217; to a young gal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half cracked about her,&#8221; puts in Bill.
&#8220;And if she won&#8217;t have him, &#8217;r her maw interferes,
I&#8217;m feared they&#8217;ll be a tragedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Low ruffian!&#8221; says Boston.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>Later on, about ten o&#8217;clock, say, I was passin&#8217;
the rest&#8217;rant, and I heerd a man singin&#8217;<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p class='i'>&#8220;Luz de mi alma!</p>
<p class='i'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luz de mi vida!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and that somethin&#8217; was &#8220;despedosin&#8217;&#8221; his heart.
(I savvy the lingo pretty good.)</p>

<p>Wal, it was that dog-goned cholo,&#8211;under
Carlota&#8217;s winda, and he had a guitar. Thunderation!
that wasn&#8217;t in our pro<i>gram!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you!&#8221; I hollered.</p>

<p>He shut up and come over, lookin&#8217; kinda as if
he&#8217;d been ketched stealin&#8217; sheep, but grinnin&#8217; so
hard his eyes was plumb closed&#8211;the mean, little,
wall-eyed, bow-laigged swine!</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro,&#8221; I says, &#8220;you&#8217; boss likely wants you.
Hit the ties.&#8221; &#8217;Cause, mebbe Carlota &#8217;d git mad
at his yelpin,&#8217; and knock the hull scheme galley-west.</p>

<p>Talk about you&#8217; cheek! Next night, that
greaser and his guitar was doin&#8217; business at the
ole stand. I let him alone. Carlota seemed t&#8217; like
it. Anyhow, she didn&#8217;t hand him out no hot
soap suds through the winda, &#8217;r no chairs and
tables.</p>

<p>I was glad things was goin&#8217; so nice. &#8217;Cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
lately I&#8217;d had t&#8217; worry about Mace a good deal.
Her letters had eased up a hull lot. Seems she&#8217;d
been under the weather fer a few days.</p>

<p>When she writ again though, she said she was
O. K., but a-course Noo York <i>was</i> lonesome
when a person was sick. Op&#8217;ra prospects? Aw,
they was <i>fine!</i></p>

<p>Next thing, I was nervouser&#8217;n a cow with the
heel-fly. <i>No</i> letters come from the little gal!&#8211;leastways,
none to Rose. And ev&#8217;ry day ole man
Sewell snooped &#8217;round the post-office, lookin&#8217;
more and more down in the mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Mace?&#8221; Rawson ast him oncet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tol&#8217;rable,&#8221; he answers, glum as all git out.</p>

<p>That kidnappin&#8217; was fixed on fer Saturday.
We didn&#8217;t tell Carlota that was the day. Her
maw might git wind of the job; &#8217;r the gal &#8217;d go
dress up, which &#8217;d spoil the real look of the hull
thing. Then, on a Saturday, after five, Pedro
was free to come in town&#8211;and most allus
showed up with some more of the cholos, pumpin&#8217;
a hand-car.</p>

<p>This Saturday he come, all right, and went
over to Sparks&#8217;s corral fer a couple of hosses.
(Us punchers &#8217;d tied our broncs over in the corral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
too, so&#8217;s we&#8217;d have to run fer &#8217;em when Pedro lit
out with the gal. And I&#8217;d picked that strawberry
roan of Sparks&#8217;s fer Boston. It was the
fastest critter on four laigs in the hull country.
Y&#8217; see, I wanted Boston t&#8217; lead the posse.)</p>

<p>Six o&#8217;clock was the time named. It &#8217;d give us
more &#8217;n two hours of day fer the chase, and then
they&#8217;d be a nice long stretch of dusk&#8211;just the
kind of light fer circlin&#8217; a&#8217; outlaw and capturin&#8217;
him, dead &#8217;r alive!</p>

<p>Wal, just afore the battle, mother, all us cow-punchers
happened into the Arnaz place. And
a-course, Boston was there. Me and him was
settin&#8217; &#8217;way back towards the kitchen-end of the
room. Pretty soon, we seen Pedro pass the front
winda, ridin&#8217; a hoss and leadin&#8217; another. His
loaded quirt was a-hangin&#8217; to his one wrist, and
on his right laig was the gun filled with blanks
that we&#8217;d left at Sparks&#8217;s fer him. He stopped
at the far corner of the house, droppin&#8217; the
bridle over the broncs&#8217; haids so they&#8217;d stand.
Then he came to the side door, opened it about
a&#8217; inch, peeked in at Carlota,&#8211;she was behind
the counter&#8211;and whistled.</p>

<p>She walked straight over to him, smilin&#8217;&#8211;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
little cut-up!&#8211;and outen the door! Fer a minute,
no sound. Then, the signal&#8211;a screech.</p>

<p>That screech was so blamed genuwine I almost
fergot to stick out my laig and trip Boston
as he come by me. Down he sprawled, them
spectacles of hisn flyin&#8217; off and bustin&#8217; to smithereens.
The boys bunched at the doors t&#8217; cut off
the Arnaz boy and the ole lady. Past &#8217;em, I
could see them two broncs, with Pedro and Carlota
aboard, makin&#8217; quick tracks up the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! yon villain has stole her!&#8221; says Sam
Barnes, throwin&#8217; up his arms like they do in one
of them the<i>ay</i>ter plays.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; yells Rawson. &#8220;We will foller and
sa-a-ave her.&#8221; Then he split fer the corral,&#8211;us
after him.</p>

<p>When we got to it, we found somethin&#8217;
funny: Our hosses was saddled and bridled all
right&#8211;<i>but ev&#8217;ry cinch was cut!</i></p>

<p>Wal, you could &#8217;a&#8217; knocked me down with a
feather!</p>

<p>That same minute, up come Hank Shackleton
on a dead run. &#8220;Boys!&#8221; he says, &#8220;that greaser
was half shot when he hit town. Got six more
jolts at Dutchy&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>Fast as we could, we got some other saddles
and clumb on&#8211;Bill and Sam and me and Shackleton,
Monkey Mike, Buckshot Milliken and
the sheriff&#8211;and made fer Hairoil&#8217;s shack.</p>

<p><i>No Carlota</i>&#8211;but that blamed straw feemale,
keeled over woeful, and a cow eatin&#8217; her hair.</p>

<p>Shiverin&#8217; snakes! but we was a sick-lookin&#8217;
bunch!</p>

<p>But we didn&#8217;t lose no time. A good way ahaid,
some dust was travellin&#8217;. We spurred towards it,
cussin&#8217; ourselves, wonderin&#8217; why Carlota didn&#8217;t
turn her hoss, &#8217;r stop, &#8217;r jump, &#8217;r put up one of
her tiger-cat fights.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s his idear?&#8221; says Monkey Mike.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s he takin&#8217; her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bee line fer the reservation,&#8221; says Buckshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spanish church there. Makin&#8217; her <i>e</i>lope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wo-o-ow!&#8221; It was Sheriff Bergin. We&#8217;d
got beyond the Bar Y ranch-house, and &#8217;d gone
down a slope into a kinda draw, like, and then up
the far side. This &#8217;d brung us out on to pretty
high ground, and we could see, about a mile off,
two hosses gallopin&#8217; side by side. &#8220;The gal&#8217;s
bronc is lame!&#8221; says the sheriff. &#8220;And Pedro&#8217;s
lickin&#8217; it. We <i>got</i> him! Pull you&#8217; guns.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span><i>Guns</i>. I got weaker&#8217;n a cat. And, all at the
same time, the other fellers remembered&#8211;and
<i>such</i> a howl. We had guns, <i>a-course</i>&#8211;<i>but they
was filled with blanks!</i></p>

<p>We slacked a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that greaser loaded?&#8221; ast Bergin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him blanks myself,&#8221; says Bill.</p>

<p>Ahaid again, faster &#8217;n ever. Carlota&#8217;s hoss
was shore givin&#8217; out&#8211;goin&#8217; on three feet, in little
jumps like a jackrabbit. Pedro wasn&#8217;t able t&#8217; git
her on to <i>his</i> bronc, &#8217;r else he was feard the critter
wouldn&#8217;t carry double. Anyhow, he was behind
her, everlastin&#8217;ly usin&#8217; his quirt&#8211;and losin&#8217;
ground.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, we was so nigh we made out t&#8217;
hear him. And when he looked back, we seen his
face was white, fer all he&#8217;s a greaser. Then, of a
suddent, he come short, half wheeled, waited till
we was closter, and fired.</p>

<p>Somethin&#8217; whistled &#8217;twixt me and the sheriff&#8211;<i>ping-ng-ng!</i> It was lead, all right!</p>

<p>And just then, whilst he was pullin&#8217; t&#8217; right
and left, scatterin&#8217; quick, but shootin&#8217; off blanks
(we was so <i>ex</i>cited), that strawberry roan of
Sparks&#8217;s come past us like a streak of lightnin&#8217;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
And on her, with his dicer gone, no glasses, a
ca&#8217;tridge-belt &#8217;round his neck, and a pistol in one
hand, was Boston!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, you fool,&#8221; yells the sheriff, &#8220;You&#8217;ll git
killed!&#8221;</p>

<p>(Tire Pedro out and then draw his fire was the
best plan, y&#8217; savvy.)</p>

<p>Boston didn&#8217;t answer&#8211;kept right on.</p>

<p>But the run was up. Pedro &#8217;d reached that ole
dobe house that Clay Peters lived in oncet, pulled
the door open, and makin&#8217; Carlota lay flat on her
saddle (<i>she was tied on!</i>) druv in her hoss. Then,
he begun t&#8217; lead in hisn&#8211;when Boston brung up
his hand and let her go&#8211;bang.</p>

<p>Say! that greaser got a surprise. He give a
yell, and drawed back, lettin&#8217; go his hoss. Then,
he shut the door to, and we seen his weasel face
at the winda.</p>

<p>Boston&#8217;s gun come up again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; I hollered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll hurt the
gal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t shoot then, but just kept goin&#8217;.
Pedro fired and missed. Next minute, Boston
was outen range on the side of the house where
they wasn&#8217;t no winda, and offen his hoss; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
the cholo was poppin&#8217; at us as we come on, and
yellin&#8217; like he was luny.</p>

<p>But Boston, it seems, could hear Carlota sobbin&#8217;
and cryin&#8217; and prayin&#8217;. And it got in to his
collar. So darned if he didn&#8217;t run right &#8217;round
to that winda and smash it in!</p>

<p>Pedro shot at him, missed; shot again, still
yellin&#8217; bloody murder.</p>

<p>Boston wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; no yellin&#8217;. He was actin&#8217;
like a blamed jack-in-the-box. Stand up, fire
through the winda, duck&#8211;stand up, duck<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>He got it. Stayed up a second too long oncet&#8211;then tumbled back&#8217;ards, kinda half runnin&#8217; as
he goes down, and laid quiet.</p>

<p>Pedro didn&#8217;t lean out t&#8217; finish him; didn&#8217;t even
take a shot at us as we pulled up byside him and
got off.</p>

<p>But the gal was callin&#8217; to us. I picked up Boston&#8217;s
gun and looked in.</p>

<p>Pedro was on the dirt floor, holdin&#8217; his right
hand with his left. (No more shovelin&#8217; fer <i>him</i>.)</p>

<p>Wal, we opened the door, led Carlota&#8217;s
hoss out, set the little gal loose, and lifted her
down.</p>

<p>At first, she didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;&#8211;just looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
to where Boston was. Then she found her feet
and went towards him, totterin&#8217; unsteady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Querido!&#8221; she calls; &#8220;querido!&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston heerd her, and begun crawlin&#8217; t&#8217; meet
her. &#8220;All right, sweetheart,&#8221; he says, &#8220;&#8211;all
right. I ain&#8217;t hurt much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they kissed&#8211;and we got <i>another</i> surprise
party!</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>That night, as I was a-settin&#8217; on a truck at the
deepot, thinkin&#8217; to myself, and watchin&#8217; acrosst
the tracks to the mesquite, here come Boston
&#8217;round the corner, and he set down byside me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Cupid?&#8221; he says, takin&#8217; holt of my
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boston,&#8221; I begun. &#8220;I&#8211;I reckon <i>you</i> don&#8217;t
need me no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; says Boston, &#8220;I don&#8217;t. And I want t&#8217;
square with y&#8217;. Now, the boys say you&#8217;re
plannin&#8217; t&#8217; go to Noo York later on&#8211;t&#8217; take the
town t&#8217; pieces and see what&#8217;s the matter with it,
eh?&#8221; And he dug me in the ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;I&#8217;ve <i>talked</i> about it&#8211;some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good idear,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;But about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
my bill&#8211;I hope you&#8217;ll think a hunderd and fifty
is fair, fer these three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boston!&#8221; I got kinda weak all to oncet. &#8220;I
cain&#8217;t take it. It wasn&#8217;t worth that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a plot,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and colour, and a bad
man, and&#8221;&#8211;smilin&#8217; awful happy&#8211;&#8220;a gal. So
you get you&#8217; trip right away. And don&#8217;t you
come back <i>alone.</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER NINE<br /><span class='h2fs'>A ROUND-UP IN CENTRAL PARK</span></h2>

<p>The boys was a-settin&#8217; &#8217;long the edge of the
freight platform, Bergin at the one end of the
line, Hairoil at the other, and all of &#8217;em either
a-chawin&#8217; &#8217;r a-smokin&#8217;. I was down in front,
doin&#8217; a promynade back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards, (I
was itchin&#8217; so to git started) and keepin&#8217; one
eye peeled through the dark towards the southwest&#8211;fer
the haidlight of ole 202.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Cupid,&#8221; Sam Barnes was sayin&#8217;,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll find a quart of tanglefoot in that satchel
of yourn. Now, you might go eat somethin&#8217; that
wouldn&#8217;t agree with you in one of them Eye-talian
rest&#8217;rants. Wal, a swaller of that firewater
&#8217;ll straighten you out pronto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam, that shore <i>is</i> thoughtful. Use my bronc
whenever you want to&#8211;she&#8217;s over in Sparks&#8217;s
corral. Allus speak t&#8217; her &#8217;fore you go up to her,
though. She&#8217;s some skittish.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>&#8220;And keep you&#8217; money in you&#8217; boot-laig,&#8221;
begun the sheriff. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heerd that in Noo York
they&#8217;s a hull lot of people that plumb wear theyselves
out figgerin&#8217; how t&#8217; git holt of cash without
workin&#8217; fer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll miss y&#8217; <i>turrible,</i> Cupid,&#8221; breaks in
Hairoil. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hardly know what Briggs &#8217;ll
do with you gone. Somehow you allus manage
t&#8217; keep the <i>ex</i>citement up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if things don&#8217;t go good in Noo York,&#8221;
adds Hank Shackleton, &#8220;why, just holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217;, Hank,&#8211;thank y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little spot was comin&#8217; and goin&#8217; &#8217;way down
the track. The bunch looked that <i>di</i>rection silent.
Pretty soon, we heerd a rumblin&#8217;, and the spot
got bigger, and steady.</p>

<p>The boys got down offen the platform and we
moseyed over t&#8217; where the end car allus stopped.</p>

<p><i>Too-oo-oot!</i></p>

<p>Shackleton reached out fer my hand. &#8220;Good-bye,
Cupid, you ole son-of-a-gun,&#8221; he says almost
squeezin&#8217; the paw offen me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take keer of you&#8217;self,&#8221; says the sheriff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them fly Noo York dudes git you
scairt none&#8221; (this was Chub).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>&#8220;<i>That</i> ain&#8217;t you&#8217; satchel, Cupid, that&#8217;s the
mail-bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, we&#8217;d rattle <i>any</i>body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Boston, <i>he</i> wants t&#8217; say good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wave t&#8217; the eatin&#8217;-house gals,&#8211;cain&#8217;t you see
&#8217;em at that upper winda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cupid,&#8221;&#8211;it was Hairoil, and he put a&#8217; arm
acrosst my shoulder&#8211;&#8220;<i>hope</i> you fergive me fer
puttin&#8217; up that shootin&#8217;-scrape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, a-<i>course,</i> I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, whisperin&#8217;, &#8220;<i>She</i> was the gal I tole you
about that time, Cupid: The one I <i>said</i> I&#8217;d marry
you off to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. So&#8211;the best <i>kind</i> of luck, ole socks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, <i>thank</i> y&#8217;, Hairoil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next, pushin&#8217; his way through the bunch, I
seen Billy Trowbridge, somethin&#8217; white in his
hand. &#8220;Cupid,&#8221; he says,&#8211;into my ear, so&#8217;s the
others couldn&#8217;t ketch it&#8211;&#8220;if the time ever
comes when the little gal makes a big success
back there in Noo York, &#8217;r if the time comes
when she&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; some of startin&#8217; home t&#8217;
Oklahomaw again, open this. It&#8217;s that other
letter of Up-State&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>&#8220;I will, Doc&#8211;I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>I clumb the steps of the end car and looked
round me. On the one side was the mesquite, all
black now, and quiet. Say! I hated t&#8217; think it
didn&#8217;t stretch all the way East! Here, on the
other side was the deepot, and Dutchy&#8217;s, and
the bunk-house, and the feed-shop, and Silverstein&#8217;s,
and the post-office<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;So long, Cupid!&#8221;&#8211;it was all-t&#8217;gether, gals
and fellers, too. Then, &#8220;Yee-ee-ee-oop!&#8221;&#8211;the
ole cow-punch yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, boys!&#8221; I waved my Stetson.</p>

<p>Next thing, Briggs City begun t&#8217; slip
back&#8217;ards&#8211;slow at first, then faster and faster.
The hollerin&#8217; of the bunch got sorta fadey; the
deepot lights got littler and littler. Off t&#8217; the
right, a new light sprung up&#8211;it was the lamp
in the sittin&#8217;-room at the Bar Y.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; I says out loud, &#8220;they&#8217;s a little, empty
rockin&#8217;-chair byside yourn t&#8217;-night. Wal, I&#8217;ll
never come back this way no more &#8217;less you&#8217; baby
gal is home at the ranch-house again t&#8217; fill it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, I picked up my satchel and hunted the
day-coach.</p>

<p>A-course, when I reached Chicago, the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
thing I done was to take a fly at that railroad on
stilts. Next, I had t&#8217; go over and turn my lanterns
on the lake. Pretty soon I was so all-fired
broke-in that I could stand on a street corner
without bein&#8217; hitched. But people was a-takin&#8217;
me fer Bill Cody, and the kids had a notion to
fall in behind when I walked any. So I made
myself look cityfied. I got a suit&#8211;a nice, kinda
brownish-reddish colour. I done my sombrero up
in a newspaper and pur<i>chased</i> a round hat, black
and turrible tony. I bought me some sateen
shirts,&#8211;black, too, with turn-down collars and
little bits of white stripes. A white satin tie last
of all, and, say! I was fixed!</p>

<p>Wal, after seein&#8217; Chicago, it stands t&#8217; reason
that Noo York cain&#8217;t git a feller scairt so awful
much. Anyhow, it didn&#8217;t <i>me</i>. The minute I got
offen the train at the Grand Central, I got my
boots greased and my clothes breshed; then I
looked up one of them Fourth of July hitchin&#8217;-posts
and had my jaw scraped and my mane cut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardner,&#8221; I says t&#8217; the barber feller, &#8220;I
want t&#8217; rent a cheap room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look in the papers,&#8221; he <i>ad</i>vises.</p>

<p>&#8217;Twixt him and me, we located a place afore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
long, and he showed me how t&#8217; git to it. Wal, sir,
I was settled in a jiffy. The room wasn&#8217;t bigger
&#8217;n a two-spot, and the bed was one of them jack-knife
kind. But I liked the looks of the shebang.
The lady that run it, she almost fell over when I
tole her I was a cow-punch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; she says, &#8220;are y&#8217; shore? You&#8217;re tall
enough, but you&#8217;re a little thick-set. I thought
all cow-boys was very slender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I says; &#8220;we&#8217;re slender in books,
I reckon. But out in Oklahomaw we come in all
styles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; she goes on, &#8220;they&#8217;s something <i>else</i>
I want to ast. Now, you ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to shoot
&#8217;round here, are y&#8217;? Would you just as lief put
you&#8217; pistols away whilst you&#8217;re in my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>I got serious then. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I says, &#8220;sorry
I cain&#8217;t oblige y&#8217;. But the boys tole me a gun is
plumb needful in Noo York. When it comes to
killin&#8217; and robbin&#8217;, the West has got to back
outen the lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>You oughta saw her face!</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t want to look fer no other room,
so I pretended t&#8217; knuckle. &#8220;I promise not to
blow out the gas with my forty-five,&#8221; I says,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
&#8220;and I won&#8217;t rope no trolley cars&#8211;if you&#8217;ll
please tell me where folks go in this town when
they want t&#8217; ride a hoss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in Central Park,&#8221; she answers, &#8220;on the
bridle path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank y&#8217;, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I says, and lit out.</p>

<p>A-course, &#8217;most any person &#8217;d wonder what
I&#8217;d ast the boardin&#8217;-house lady <i>that</i> fer. Wal, I
ast it &#8217;cause I knowed Macie Sewell good enough
to lay my money on <i>one</i> thing: She was too all-fired
gone on hosses to stay offen a saddle more&#8217;n
twenty-four hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>I passed a right peaceful afternoon, a-settin&#8217;
at the bottom of a statue of a man ridin&#8217; a big
bronc, with a tall lady runnin&#8217; ahaid and wavin&#8217;
a feather. It was at the beginnin&#8217; of the park,
and I expected t&#8217; see Mace come lopin&#8217; by any
minute. Sev&#8217;ral gals <i>did</i> show up, and one &#8217;r two
of &#8217;em rid off on bob-tailed hosses, follered by
gezabas in white pants and doctor&#8217;s hats. Heerd
afterwards they was grooms, and bein&#8217; the gals&#8217;
broncs was bob-tailed, they had to go &#8217;long to
keep off the flies.</p>

<p>But Mace, she didn&#8217;t show up. Next day, I
waited same way. Day after, ditto. Seemed t&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
me ev&#8217;ry blamed man, woman and child in the
hull city passed me but her. And I didn&#8217;t know
a <i>one</i> of &#8217;em. A Chink come by oncet, and when
I seen his pig-tail swingin&#8217;, I felt like I wanted
to shake his fist. About that time I begun to git
worried, too. &#8220;If she ain&#8217;t ridin&#8217;,&#8221; I says to myself,
&#8220;how &#8217;m I ever goin&#8217; to locate her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another day, when I was settin&#8217; amongst the
kids, watchin&#8217;, I seen a feller steerin&#8217; my way.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; I says, &#8217;cause he didn&#8217;t have the
spurs of a decent man.</p>

<p>Wal, when he came clost, he begun to smile
kinda sloppy, like he&#8217;d just had two &#8217;r three.
&#8220;Why, hello, ole boy,&#8221; he says, puttin&#8217; out a
bread-hooker; &#8220;I met you out West, didn&#8217;t I?
How are y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had the sittywaytion in both gauntlets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yas,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;and I&#8217;m tickled to
sight a familiar face. Fer by jingo! I&#8217;m busted.
Can you loan me a dollar?&#8221;</p>

<p>He got kinda sick &#8217;round the gills. &#8220;Wal, the
fact is,&#8221; he says, swallerin&#8217; two &#8217;r three times,
&#8220;I&#8217;m clean broke myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a gal with a pink cinch comes
walkin&#8217; along. She was one of them Butte-belle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
lookin&#8217; ladies, with blazin&#8217; cheeks, and hair that&#8217;s
a cross &#8217;twixt <i>mo</i>lasses candy and the pelt of a
kit-fox. She was leadin&#8217; a dog that looked
plumb ashamed of hisself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty gal,&#8221; says the mealy-mouthed gent,
grinnin&#8217; some more. &#8220;And I know her. Like t&#8217;
be interdooced?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother,&#8221; I says. (Her hay was a little
too weathered fer <i>me</i>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice red cheeks,&#8221; he says, rubbin&#8217; his paws
t&#8217;gether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-a-as,&#8221; I says, &#8220;<i>mighty nice</i>. But you
oughta see the squaws out in Oklahomaw. They
varies it with yalla and black.&#8221;</p>

<p>He give me a kinda keen look. Then he
moseyed.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t more &#8217;n a&#8217; hour afterwards when
somebody passed that I knowed&#8211;in one of them
dinky, little buggies that ain&#8217;t got no cover.
Who d&#8217; you think it was?&#8211;that Doctor Bugs!</p>

<p>I was at his hoss&#8217;s haid &#8217;fore ever he seen me.
&#8220;Hole up, Simpson,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I want t&#8217; talk to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Alec Lloyd!&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>&#8220;How &#8217;d <i>you</i> git here?&#8221; He stuck out one of
them soft paws of hisn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I got turned this way, and then I just
follered my nose.&#8221; (I didn&#8217;t take his hand. I&#8217;d
as soon &#8217;a&#8217; touched a snake.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m glad t&#8217; see you.&#8221; (That was a
whopper.) &#8220;How&#8217;s ev&#8217;rybody in Briggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind about Briggs. I want t&#8217; ast
<i>you</i> somethin&#8217;: Where&#8217;s Macie Sewell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that,&#8221; I come back. &#8220;I know
you&#8217;re lyin&#8217;. When you talked that gal into
the op&#8217;ra business, you had &#8217;a&#8217; ax t&#8217; grind, yas,
you did. Now, <i>where is she?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked plumb nervous. &#8220;I tell y&#8217;, I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; he answers; &#8220;<i>honest,</i> I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve saw
her just oncet&#8211;the day after she got here. I offered
t&#8217; do anythin&#8217; I could fer her, but she
didn&#8217;t seem t&#8217; appreciate my kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I says. &#8220;But, Simpson, listen:
If you&#8217;ve said a word t&#8217; that gal that you oughtn&#8217;t
to, &#8217;r if you&#8217;ve follered &#8217;round after her any
when she didn&#8217;t want you should, you&#8217;ll hear from
<i>me</i>. Salt <i>that</i> down.&#8221; And I let him go.</p>

<p>Meetin&#8217; <i>him</i> that-a-way, made me feel a heap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
better. If I could run into the only man I
knowed in the city of Noo York, then, sometime,
I&#8217;d shore come acrosst <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>That was the last day I set on the steps of the
statue. About sundown, I ast a police feller if
anybody could ride in the park without me seein&#8217;
&#8217;em from where I was. &#8220;Why, yas,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;they&#8217;s plenty of entrances, all right. This is
just where a few comes in and out. The best
way to see the riders is to go ride you&#8217;self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think of that <i>afore</i>.
But I didn&#8217;t lose no time. Next mornin&#8217;, I was
up turrible early and makin&#8217; fer a barn clost to
the park. I found one easy&#8211;pretty frequent
thereabouts, y&#8217; savvy,&#8211;and begun t&#8217; dicker on
rentin&#8217; a hoss. Prices was high, but I done my
best, and they led out a nag. And what do you
think? It had on one of them saddles with no
horn,&#8211;a shore enough <i>muley</i>.</p>

<p>Say! that was a hard proposition. &#8220;I ast
fer a saddle,&#8221; I says, &#8220;not a postage stamp.&#8221;
But the stable-keeper didn&#8217;t have no other. So I
got on and rode slow. When I struck the timber,
I felt better, and I started my bronc up.
She was one of them kind that can go all day on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
a shingle. And her front legs acted plumb
funny&#8211;jerked up and down. I figgered it was
the spring halt. But pretty soon I seen other
hosses goin&#8217; the same way. So I swallered it, like
I done the saddle.</p>

<p>But they was one thing about my cayuse made
me hot. She wouldn&#8217;t lope. No, ma&#8217;am, it was
trot, trot, trot, trot, till the roots of my hair was
loose, and the lights was near shook outen me.
You bet I was mighty glad none of the outfit
could see me!</p>

<p>But if they&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; thought <i>I</i> was funny, they&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; had a duck-fit at what I seen. First a passel
of men come by, all in bloomers, humpin&#8217; fast,&#8211;<i>up</i>
and down, <i>up</i> and down&#8211;Monkey Mike,
shore&#8217;s you live! None of &#8217;em looked joyful, and
you could pretty nigh hear they knees squeak!
Then &#8217;long come a gal, humpin&#8217; just the same,
and hangin&#8217; on to the side of her cayuse fer dear
life, lookin&#8217; ev&#8217;ry step like she was goin&#8217; to
avalanche. And oncet in a while I passed a feller
that was runnin&#8217; a cultivator down the trail,&#8211;to
keep it nice and soft, I reckon, fer the ladies
and gents t&#8217; fall on.</p>

<p>But whilst I was gettin&#8217; kinda used to things,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
I didn&#8217;t stop keepin&#8217; a&#8217; eye out. I went clean
&#8217;round the track twicet. No Macie. I tell y&#8217;, I
begun to feel sorta caved-in. Then, all of a suddent,
just as I was toppin&#8217; a little rise of ground,
I seen her!</p>

<p><i>She</i> wasn&#8217;t hangin&#8217; on to the side of her hoss,
no, ma&#8217;am! She was ridin&#8217; the prettiest <i>kind</i> of
a bronc, fat and sassy. And she was settin&#8217;
a-straddle, straight and graceful, in a spick-and-span
new suit, and a three-cornered hat like
George Washington.</p>

<p>I let out a yell that would &#8217;a&#8217; raised the hair
of a reservation Injun. &#8220;Macie Sewell!&#8221; I
says&#8211;just like that. I give my blamed little nag
a hit that put her into her jerky trot. And I
come &#8217;longside, humpin&#8217; like Sam Hill.</p>

<p>She pulled her hoss down to a standstill; and
them long eye-winkers of hern lifted straight
up into the air, she was so surprised. &#8220;Alec!&#8221;
she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, Alec,&#8221; I answers. &#8220;Aw, dear little gal,
is y&#8217; glad t&#8217; see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, what &#8217;re <i>you</i> doin&#8217; here!&#8221; she goes on.
&#8220;I cain&#8217;t hardly believe what I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so blamed flustered, and so happy, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
so&#8211;so scairt, that I had t&#8217; go say the <i>one</i> thing
that was plumb foolish. &#8220;I&#8217;m on hand t&#8217; take
you back home if you&#8217;re ready,&#8221; I answers.
(Hole on till I give myself another good, ten-hoss-power
kick!)</p>

<p>Up till now, her look &#8217;d been all friendly
enough. But now of a suddent it got cold and
offish. &#8220;Take me home!&#8221; she begun; &#8220;<i>home!</i>
Wal, I like that! Why, I&#8217;m just about t&#8217; make
a great, big success, <i>yas</i>. And I&#8217;ll thank you not
t&#8217; spoil my chanst with any more of you&#8217; tricks.&#8221;
She swung her bronc round into the trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie! Spoil you&#8217; chanst!&#8221; I answers.
&#8220;Why, honey, I wouldn&#8217;t do that. I only want
t&#8217; be friends<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes can give out fire just like her paw&#8217;s.
And when I said that, she give me one turrible
mad stare. Then, she throwed up her chin,
spurred her bronc, and went trottin&#8217; off,
a-humpin&#8217; the same as the rest of the ladies.</p>

<p>I follered after her as fast as I could.
&#8220;Macie,&#8221; I says, &#8220;talk ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; show you
how I feel. And I&#8217;ll not speak to you again till
you want me to. But I&#8217;ll allus be clost by. And
if ever you need me<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>She set her hoss into a run then. So I fell behind&#8211;and
come nigh pullin&#8217; the mouth plumb
outen that crow-bait I was on. &#8220;Wal, Mister
Cupid,&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;that Kansas cyclone
the boss talked about seems t&#8217; be still a-movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t discouraged, though,&#8211;I wasn&#8217;t discouraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of these times,&#8221; I says, &#8220;she&#8217;ll come t&#8217;
know that I only want t&#8217; help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next mornin&#8217;, I started my jumpin&#8217;-jack
business again. And <i>that</i> whack, I shore got a
rough layout: &#8217;Round and &#8217;round that blamed
park, two hunderd and forty-&#8217;leven times, without
grub, &#8217;r a drink, &#8217;r even water! And me
a-hirin&#8217; that hoss <i>by the hour!</i></p>

<p>Just afore sundown, she showed up, and
passed me with her eyes fixed on a spot about
two miles further on. A little huffy, yet, y&#8217;
might say!</p>

<p>I joked to that three-card-monte feller, you
recollect, about bein&#8217; busted. Wal, it was beginnin&#8217;
t&#8217; look like no joke. &#8217;Cause that very
next day I took some stuff acrosst the street to
a pawnbroker gent&#8217;s, and hocked it. Then I sit
down and writ a postal card t&#8217; the boys. &#8220;<i>Pass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
&#8217;round the hat,</i>&#8221; I says on the postal card, &#8220;<i>and
send me the collection. Bar that Mexic. Particulars
later on.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, fer a week, things run smooth. When
Mace seen it was no use to change the time fer
her ride, she kept to the mornin&#8217;. It saved me a
pile. But she wouldn&#8217;t so much as look at me.
Aw, I felt fewey, just <i>fewey</i>.</p>

<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t figger on, though&#8211;that
was the <i>po</i>lice. They&#8217;re white, all right (I mean
the <i>po</i>lice that ride &#8217;round the park). Pretty
soon, they noticed I was allus ridin&#8217; behind
Macie. I guess they thought I was tryin&#8217; to
bother her. Anyhow, one of &#8217;em stopped me one
mornin&#8217;. &#8220;Young feller,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you&#8217;d better
ride along Riverside oncet in a while. Ketch
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, sir,&#8221; I says, salutin&#8217;.</p>

<p>Wal, I <i>was</i> up a stump. If I was to be druv
out of the park, how was I ever goin&#8217; to be on
hand when Macie &#8217;d take a notion t&#8217; speak.</p>

<p>But I hit on a plan that was somethin&#8217; <i>won</i>-derful.
I follered her out and found where she
stalled her hoss. Next day, I borraed a&#8217; outfit
and waited nigh her barn till she come in sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
Then, I fell in behind&#8211;<i>dressed like one of them
blamed grooms.</i></p>

<p>I thought I was slick, and I <i>was</i>&#8211;fer a week.
But them park <i>po</i>lice is rapid on faces. And the
first one that got a good square look at me and
my togs knowed me instant. He didn&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217; to me, but loped off. Pretty soon, another
one come back&#8211;a moustached gent, a right
dudey one, with yalla tucks on his sleeves.</p>

<p>He rides square up to me. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;are you acquainted with that young lady on
ahaid?&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to look as sad and innocent as a stray
maverick. But it was no go. &#8220;Wal,&#8221; I answers,
&#8220;our hosses nicker to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled at his moustache fer a while. &#8220;<i>You</i>
ain&#8217;t no groom,&#8221; he says fin&#8217;lly. &#8220;Where you
from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from the Bar Y Ranch, Oklahomaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That so!&#8221; It seemed to plumb relieve him.
All of a suddent, he got as friendly as the devil.
&#8220;Wal, how&#8217;s the stock business?&#8221; he ast. And I
says, &#8220;Cows is O. K.&#8221; &#8220;And how&#8217;s the climate
down you&#8217; way? And how&#8217;s prospects of the
country openin&#8217; up fer farmers?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>After that, I shed the groom duds, and not a
<i>po</i>lice gent ever more &#8217;n nodded at me. That
Bar Y news seemed to make &#8217;em shore easy in
they conscience.</p>

<p>But that didn&#8217;t help me any with <i>her</i>. She
was just as offish as ever. Why, one day when it
rained, and we got under the same bridge, she
just talked to her hoss all the time.</p>

<p>I went home desp&#8217;rate. The boys &#8217;d sent me
some cash, but I was shy again. And I&#8217;d been to
the pawnbroker feller&#8217;s so many times that I
couldn&#8217;t look a Jew in the face without takin&#8217;
out my watch.</p>

<p>That night I mailed postal number two.
&#8220;Take up a collection,&#8221; I says again; and added,
&#8220;Pull that greaser&#8217;s laig.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knowed it couldn&#8217;t allus go on like that.
And, by jingo! seems as if things come my way
again. Fer one mornin&#8217;, when I was settin&#8217; in a
caffy eatin&#8217; slap-jacks, I heerd some fellers
talkin&#8217; about a herd of Texas hosses that had
stampeded in the streets the night back. Wal, I
ast &#8217;em a question &#8217;r two, and then I lit out fer
Sixty-four Street, my eyes plumb sore fer a
look at a Western hoss with a&#8217; ingrowin&#8217; lope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>When I got to the corral, what do you think?
Right in front of my eyes, a-lookin&#8217; at the herd,
and a-pointin&#8217; out her pick, was&#8211;Macie Sewell!</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t let her see me. I just started fer a
harness shop, and I bought a pair of spurs.
&#8220;<i>Pre</i>pare, m&#8217; son,&#8221; I says to myself; &#8220;it&#8217;ll all
be over soon. They&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be trouble, Cupid,
trouble, when Mace tries to ride a Texas bronc
with a city edication that ain&#8217;t complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t show up in the park that day. I
jigged &#8217;round, just the same, workin&#8217; them
spurs. But early next mornin&#8217;, as I done time on
my postage stamp, here Mace huv in sight.</p>

<p>Shore enough, she was on a new hoss. It was
one of them blue roans, with a long tail, and a
roached mane. Gen&#8217;ally that breed can go like
greased lightnin&#8217;, and outlast any other critter
on four laigs. But this one didn&#8217;t put up much
speed that trip. She&#8217;d been car-bound seventeen
days.</p>

<p>Clost behind her, I come, practicin&#8217; a knee
grip.</p>

<p>Nothin&#8217; happened that mornin&#8217;. Ev&#8217;ry time
she got where the trail runs &#8217;longside the wagon-road,
none of them locoed bull&#8217;s-eye Simpson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
vehicles was a-passin&#8217;. When she went to go into
her stable, Mace slowed her down till the street
cars was gone by. The blue roan was meeker &#8217;n
a blind purp.</p>

<p>But I knowed it couldn&#8217;t <i>last</i>.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the roan come good and
ready. She done a fancy gait into the park.
Say! a J. I. C. bit couldn&#8217;t a&#8217; helt her! &#8217;Twixt
Fifty-nine and the resservoyer, she lit just <i>four
times;</i> and ev&#8217;ry time she touched, she kicked
dirt into the eyes of the stylish <i>po</i>lice gent that
was keepin&#8217; in handy reach. A little further
north, where they&#8217;s a hotel, she stood on her hind
laigs t&#8217; look at the scenery.</p>

<p>I begun to git scairt. &#8220;Speak &#8217;r <i>no</i> speak,&#8221;
I says to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to move up.&#8221;</p>

<p>That very minute, things come to a haid!</p>

<p>We was all three turned south, when &#8217;long
come a goggle-eyed smarty in one of them
snortin&#8217; Studebakers. The second the smarty
seen Mace was pretty, he blowed his horn to
make her look at him. Wal! that roan turned
tail and come nigh t&#8217; doin&#8217; a leap-frog over me.
The skunk in the buzz-wagon tooted again. And
we was off!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>We took the return trip short cut. First we
hit the brush, Mace&#8217;s hoss breakin&#8217; trail, mine a
clost second, the <i>po</i>lice gent number three. Then
we hit open country, where they&#8217;s allus a lot of
young fellers and gals battin&#8217; balls over fly-nets.
The crowd scattered, and we sailed by,
takin&#8217; them nets like claim-jumpers. I heerd a
whistle ahaid oncet, and seen a fat <i>po</i>liceman
runnin&#8217; our way, wavin&#8217; his arms. Then we went
tearin&#8217; on,&#8211;no stops fer stations&#8211;&#8217;round the
lake, down a road that was thick with keerages,&#8211;beatin&#8217; ev&#8217;rybody in sight&#8211;then into timber
again.</p>

<p>It was that takin&#8217; to the woods the second time
that done it. In Central Park is a place where
they have ducks and geese (keep the Mayor in
aigs, I heerd). Wal, just to east, like, of that
place, is a butte, all rocks and wash-outs. The
blue roan made that butte slick as a Rocky
Mountain goat. (We&#8217;d shook off the <i>po</i>lice
gent.) At the top, she pitched plumb over, losin&#8217;
Mace so neat it didn&#8217;t more &#8217;n jar her. My hoss
got down on his knees, and I come offen <i>my</i>
perch. Then both broncs went on.</p>

<p>I was winded, so I didn&#8217;t speak up fer a bit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
Fact is, I didn&#8217;t exac&#8217;ly know what to <i>re</i>mark.
Oncet I thought I&#8217;d say, &#8220;You ridin&#8217; a diff&#8217;rent
hoss t&#8217;day, Mace?&#8221; &#8217;r &#8220;That roan of yourn can
lope some.&#8221; But both bein&#8217; kinda personal, I
kept still.</p>

<p>But pretty soon, I got a hunch. &#8220;I just
<i>knowed</i> that blamed muley saddle &#8217;d butt me off
some day,&#8221; I says. &#8220;It was shore accomodatin&#8217;,
though, to let me down right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. She was settin agin a
tree, another of them two-mile looks in her eyes,
and she was gazin&#8217; off west.</p>

<p>I lent her way just a little. &#8220;What you
watchin&#8217;, honey?&#8221; I ast.</p>

<p>She blushed, awful cute.</p>

<p>I could feel my heart movin&#8217; like a circular
saw&#8211;two ways fer Sunday. &#8220;Honey, what
you watchin&#8217;?&#8221; This time I kinda whispered it.</p>

<p>She reached fer her George Washington, and
begun fixin&#8217; to go. &#8220;The sky,&#8221; she says, some
short.</p>

<p>I sighed, and pretended t&#8217; watch the sky, too.
It looked yalla, like somebody &#8217;d hit it with a
aig.</p>

<p>After while, I couldn&#8217;t stand it no longer&#8211;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
started in again. &#8220;Give me a fair shake, Macie,&#8221;
I says. I was lookin&#8217; at her. Say! they wasn&#8217;t
no squaw paint on <i>her</i> cheeks, and no do-funny,
drug-store stuff in that pretty hair of hern. And
them grey eyes<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!</p>

<p>But she seemed a hull county off from me,
and they was a right cold current blowin&#8217; in my
<i>di</i>rection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mace,&#8221; I begun again, &#8220;since you come t&#8217;
Noo York you ain&#8217;t got you&#8217;self promised, &#8217;r
nothin&#8217; like that, have you? If you have, I&#8217;ll go
back and make that Briggs City bunch look like
a lot of colanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her haid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, Mace!&#8221; I says, turrible easied in my
mind. &#8220;And&#8211;and, little gal, has that bug doc
been a-holdin&#8217; down a chair at you&#8217; house of
Sunday nights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8211;he come just oncet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why just oncet, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want him t&#8217; come no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said somethin&#8217; insultin.&#8217; <i>I</i> know. And
when I see him again<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me square then, and I seen a
shine in them sweet eyes. &#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
&#8220;you ast me oncet t&#8217; cut that man out. Wal,
when I got here, it was the only thing I could do
fer&#8211;fer you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My little gal!&#8211;and nobody else ain&#8217;t been
visitin&#8217; you. Aw! I&#8217;m a jealous critter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody else. People ain&#8217;t very sociable
here.&#8221; Her lip kinda trembled.</p>

<p>That hurt me, and I run outen talk, fer all I
had a heap t&#8217; say. They was a lot of twitterin&#8217;
goin&#8217; on overhaid, and she was peekin&#8217; up and
&#8217;round, showing a chin that was enough t&#8217; coop
the little birds right outen the trees.</p>

<p>I lent closter. &#8220;Say, Mace,&#8221; I begun again,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t this park O. K. fer green grass? I reckon
the Bar Y cows &#8217;d like to be turned loose here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled a little, awful tender. &#8220;Bar Y!&#8221;
she says, pullin&#8217; at her gauntlets.</p>

<p>It give me spunk. &#8220;Mace,&#8221; I says again, &#8220;if
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been mean, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; let the parson go on
marryin&#8217; us, wouldn&#8217;t I? Did you ever think of
that, little gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down, blinkin&#8217;.</p>

<p>I reached over and got holt of one of her
hands. I was breathin&#8217; like pore Up-State.
&#8220;Honey,&#8221; I says, &#8220;honey, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>She looked square at me. &#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says,
&#8220;you didn&#8217;t understand me. I ain&#8217;t the kind of a
gal that can be roped and hobbled and led on a
hackamore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you ain&#8217;t the kind t&#8217; dance with greasers,&#8221;
I says, &#8220;&#8211;if you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; back to our first
little fuss. <i>No,</i> you <i>ain&#8217;t</i>. You&#8217;re too darned
nice fer such cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>By then, I was shakin&#8217; like I had the buck-fever.
&#8220;Macie,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; t&#8217;
let me come and see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal&#8211;wal<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I got holt of her other hand. &#8220;Aw, little
gal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;nobody wants you t&#8217; win out more
&#8217;n I do. <i>I&#8217;</i>m no dawg-in-the-manger, Macie.
You got a&#8217; <i>awful</i> fine voice. Go ahaid&#8211;and be
the biggest singer in Amuricaw. But, honey,&#8211;that
needn&#8217;t t&#8217; keep you from likin&#8217; me&#8211;from
likin&#8217; ole Alec, that cain&#8217;t live without his dear
little gal<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> like y&#8217;! And didn&#8217;t I allus say you was
t&#8217; come on when I made a success?&#8221;</p>

<p>She come into my arms then. And, aw! I
knowed <i>just</i> how lonesome she&#8217;d been, pore little
sweetheart! by the way she clung t&#8217; me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;Alec!&#8211;my Alec!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind! honey dear, never mind! I&#8217;m
here t&#8217; take keer of y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I says, &#8220;Macie, I bought somethin&#8217;
fer you a while back.&#8221; (I felt in my vest
pocket.) &#8220;Here it is. Will you look at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked. And her pretty face got all smiles
and blushes, and her eyes tearful. &#8220;Alec!&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;Aint it <i>beau</i>tiful!&#8221; And she
reached out her left hand t&#8217; me.</p>

<p>I took it in both of mine&#8211;clost, fer a second.
Then I sorted out that slim third finger of hern,&#8211;and slipped on my little brandin&#8217;-iron.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> street Mace lived on was turrible narra.
Why, if a long-horn had &#8217;a&#8217; been druv through it,
he could &#8217;a&#8217; just give a wiggle of his haid and
busted all the windas in the block. And her
house! It was nigh as dark as the inside of a cow,
and I <i>judged</i> they was a last-year&#8217;s cabbage
a-wanderin&#8217; &#8217;round somewheres. Wal, never mind.
Two shakes of a lamb&#8217;s tail, and I&#8217;d clumb about
a hunderd steps and&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are y&#8217;, little gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alive and kickin&#8217;, Alec.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ast me in. A kinda ole lady was over to
one side, cookin&#8217;. At a table was two gents, the
one young, with a complexion like the bottom-side
of a watermelon; the other about fifty, with
a long coat, a vest all over coffee, and no more
chin&#8217;n a gopher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Whipple,&#8221; says Macie, &#8220;Mister
Lloyd.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m tickled t&#8217; death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hair Von&#8221; (somethin&#8217;-r&#8217;-other), &#8220;Mister
Lloyd.&#8221; (Don&#8217;t wonder she called him &#8220;<i>Hair.</i>&#8221;
By thunder! he had a mane two feet long!)
&#8220;And Mister Jones.&#8221; (I ketched <i>that</i> name
O. K.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Lloyd,&#8221; says the ole lady, &#8220;will you
have some breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt like sayin&#8217; they &#8217;d likely be blamed little
fer <i>me,</i> &#8217;cause them two gezabas was just a-<i>hoppin&#8217;</i>
it in to &#8217;em. But I only answers, &#8220;Thank y&#8217;,
I just et in one of them bong-tong rest&#8217;rants
that&#8217;s down in a cellar, and so, ma&#8217;am, my breadbasket&#8217;s
plumb full.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sit down on a trunk (it had a tidy over it, but
I knowed it was a <i>trunk</i> all right), and Macie,
she sit down byside me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec,&#8221; she begun,&#8211;say! she looked mighty
sweet!&#8211;&#8220;t&#8217;-night is a&#8217; awful important night
in my life. I been a-studyin&#8217; with Hair Von&#8221;
(you know), &#8220;and now I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to have a
<i>re</i>cital. And what d&#8217; you think? Seenyer&#8221; (I
fergit who, this minute), &#8220;the grea-a-at impressyroa,
is comin&#8217; to hear me. And he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to put
me into grand op&#8217;ra.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; says Long-hair, swellin&#8217; up. &#8220;The
Seenyer is my friend, and any favour<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned and looked clost at Macie. Her face
was all alive, she was so happy, and her eyes was
dancin&#8217;. &#8220;You&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; t&#8217; make you&#8217; big stab
t&#8217;-night,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Wal, I shore wish you luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I took another look at that Perfessor&#8211;and
of a suddent I begun to wonder <i>if all the
cards was on the table.</i> &#8217;Cause he was too oily to
be genuwine. And I&#8217;d saw his stripe afore&#8211;&#8220;even
up on the red and white, five to one on the
blue, and ten to one on the numbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be a second Patty,&#8221; he says, puttin&#8217;
out a bread-hooker fer more feed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take another slice of toast,&#8221; says Melon-face,
&#8220;and a&#8217; aig and a third cup&#8211;it&#8217;s <i>so</i> good,
Miss Sewell, I&#8217;m really <i>ashamed,</i> yas, I <i>am.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, I didn&#8217;t say much&#8211;just plumb
petryfied watchin&#8217; them two gents shovel. Talk
about you&#8217; grizzly in the springtime! And you
bet they was no gittin&#8217; shet of &#8217;em till they couldn&#8217;t
hole no more.</p>

<p>But, fin&#8217;lly, they moseyed, and me and Macie
and the ole lady had a chin. It come out that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
Long-hair (<i>and</i> his friend) showed up ev&#8217;ry
mornin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;And allus gits his breakfast,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, in Noo York, folks drop &#8217;round that&#8211;a-way,&#8221; she answers. &#8220;It&#8217;s Bohemia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bohemia&#8211;you mean a kinda free hand-out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alec! <i>No!</i> Bohemians divvy with each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seem&#8217;s t&#8217; me Macie Sewell does <i>most</i> of the
divvyin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People
with artistic temper&#8217;ments don&#8217;t think about such&#8211;such common things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Just the same, that artistic team of
yourn was shore stuck on boiled aigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>That ruffled her up some. &#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says,
&#8220;you mustn&#8217;t run down the Perfessor. He&#8217;s a
big musician.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;if hair makes a big musician,
&#8217;Pache Sam oughta lead the band.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s been awful good to me. Why, he&#8217;s
let go dozens and <i>dozens</i> of rich pupils to come
here ev&#8217;ry day and give me my lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer how much?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8220;What?&#8221; She got red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fer how much?&#8221; I ast again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five dollars,&#8221; she answers.</p>

<p>I snickered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he charges all the others <i>ten,</i>&#8221; she puts
in quick. &#8220;He come down in the price &#8217;cause he
was so wrapped up in my <i>ca</i>reer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money lastin&#8217;?&#8221; I ast, and looked at the ole
lady.</p>

<p>She give me the high sign.</p>

<p>But Macie answered cheerful. &#8220;It&#8217;s carried me
good so far,&#8221; she says; &#8220;and after t&#8217;-night I can
stand on my own feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon you won&#8217;t mind my comin&#8217; t&#8217; hear
you,&#8221; I says. (&#8217;Cause I&#8217;d got a&#8217; idear what I was
goin&#8217; to do.) She said come ahaid. Then I skun
out.</p>

<p>First off, I hunted one of them sun-bonnet
keeriges. The feller that owned it was h&#8217;isted
&#8217;way up on top, and he had a face like a cured
ham. I tole him who I was goin&#8217; t&#8217; visit, and ast
him what &#8217;d be the damage if he carted me that
far. He said a two spot &#8217;d do the trick, so I clumb
in, he give his broomtail a lick, and we was off in
a bunch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>Wal, fer the balance of that day, you can bet
I didn&#8217;t let no grass sprout under <i>my</i> moccasins.
And when I turned up, &#8217;twixt eight and nine
o&#8217;clock at that <i>re</i>cital, I was a-smilin&#8217; like Teddy&#8211;and loaded fer bear!</p>

<p>It was at Long-Hair&#8217;s shebang. He took me
into a big room where they was about a dozen
ladies and gents. But I couldn&#8217;t hardly see &#8217;em.
They was plenty of gas fixin&#8217;s, only he had &#8217;em
turned &#8217;way down, and little red parasol-jiggers
over &#8217;em. And they was some punk-sticks
a-burnin&#8217; in a corner.</p>

<p>If you want t&#8217; ast <i>me,</i> I think I hit the funny
spot of that bunch right good and hard. The
women kinda giggled at each other, and the men
cocked they eyes at the ceilin&#8217; and put they hands
to they mouths. But I wasn&#8217;t nigh as big a freak
to them as they was t&#8217; <i>me!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; I says to Macie, &#8217;way low, &#8220;where &#8217;d
you round up this passel of what-is-its?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ssh!&#8221; she whispers back. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hear you!
Most of &#8217;em is big artists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; I got turrible solemn. &#8220;Have they
brought they temper&#8217;ments with &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t devil me, Alec,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But
honest, ain&#8217;t this Bohemian atmosphere just
grand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I says, sniffin&#8217; it, &#8220;it reminds <i>me</i> of a
Chinee wash-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>That wasn&#8217;t the worst of it. The men was
tankin&#8217; up like the Ole Harry&#8211;right in front of
the women! And on beer! What d&#8217; you think!
<i>Beer!</i></p>

<p>And the ladies&#8211;say! if they was t&#8217; wear
them kind of dresses out our way (not more&#8217;n a
pocket-handkerchief of cloth in the waist, that&#8217;s
straight), why, they &#8217;d git run in to the cooler
<i>shore</i>. And, by thunder! some of &#8217;em was smokin&#8217;!
<i>Smokin&#8217;!</i> And they wasn&#8217;t a greaser gal
amongst &#8217;em, neither.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a place I got in to?&#8221; I ast
Macie. Gee! I felt turrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ssh! Long-hair is goin&#8217; to play a pyano piece
he made up a-a-all by hisself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he done it. First, he goes soft, fingerin&#8217;
up and down, and movin&#8217; from side t&#8217; side like his
chair was hot. Then, he took a runnin&#8217; jump at
hisself and worked harder. But they wasn&#8217;t the
sign of a tune&#8211;just jiggles. Next, by jingo! it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
was help you&#8217;self to the gravy! He everlastin&#8217;ly
lambasted them keys, and knocked the lights
plumb outen that pore instrument.</p>

<p>Jumpin&#8217; buffalo! I got t&#8217; laughin&#8217; so I kinda
tipped over again a&#8217; iron thing that was set clost
to the wall, and come blamed nigh burnin&#8217; the
hand offen me.</p>

<p>When I come to, he was done and down, and a
bleached lady, so whitewashed and painted she
was plumb disguised, was settin&#8217; afore the pyano.
Then up gits a tall gal, skinny, long neck, forrid
like a fish, hair that hadn&#8217;t been curried since
week a-fore last.</p>

<p>She begun t&#8217; sing like a dyin&#8217; calf&#8211;eyes shut,
and makin&#8217; faces. But pretty soon, she took a
<i>new</i> holt, and got to goin&#8217; uphill and down, faster
&#8217;n Sam Hill; then &#8217;round and &#8217;round, like a dawg
after its tail; then hiccupin&#8217;; then&#8211;she kinda
shook herself&#8211;and let out a last whoppin&#8217; beller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Macie,&#8221; I says, &#8220;do you have t&#8217; herd with
this outfit <i>reg&#8217;lar?</i> Why, say, <i>all</i> the wild Injuns
ain&#8217;t out West.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;. Pore little gal, she was
watchin&#8217; the door. And Mister Long-hair? He
was wanderin&#8217; &#8217;round, lookin&#8217; powerful oneasy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
(He&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; better, the scale-haid!) &#8217;Fore long, he
goes outside.</p>

<p>Up gits a short, stumpy feller with a fiddle.
All the rest begun t&#8217; holler and clap. Stumpy, he
bowed and flopped his ears, and then he went at
that little, ole fiddle of hisn like he&#8217;d snatch it
bald-haided. Wal, <i>that</i> was bully!</p>

<p>And now it was Macie they wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>he</i> ain&#8217;t here yet,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>Long-hair come back just then. &#8220;I <i>re</i>gret to

(the impressyroa) &#8220;cain&#8217;t run over t&#8217;-night. But
he&#8217;ll be to my next little <i>re</i>cital a month from
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>month,</i>&#8221; repeats Macie. Her face fell a
mile, and she got as white as chalk-rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; says the Perfessor, rubbin&#8217; his
hands. &#8220;Go ahaid and sing anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she stood up, tremblin&#8217; a little. Long-hair
sit down to the pyano, and this was it!</p>

<p>It was a shame. But Macie done her best.
When she ended up, they hollered fer more, and
Long-hair like to break hisself in two, bowin&#8217;.</p>

<p>She just stood there&#8211;like she&#8217;d been run to
ground. The Perfessor waved his hand. &#8220;The
Jew&#8217;s song from Fowst,&#8221; he calls out.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t stand it no longer. I lent towards
her. &#8220;The Mohawk Vale,&#8221; I says; &#8220;<i>please</i> sing
The Mohawk Vale.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd giggled. The Perfessor, he started
to laugh, too&#8211;but ketched my eye, and coughed.</p>

<p>Macie turned towards him. &#8220;A&#8217; ole friend; I&#8217;d
like to,&#8221; she says. And sit down to play fer herself.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>

<p>She helt herself straight, and tried t&#8217; stick it
out. But she couldn&#8217;t. I seen her shake a little,
her voice got husky,&#8211;and she bent &#8217;way over,
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Sewell!&#8221; they exclaims, &#8220;why,
what&#8217;s the <i>matter?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, I gits up. &#8220;<i>Ex</i>cuse me,&#8221; I says, &#8220;fer

vamose&#8211;&#8217;ceptin&#8217; the Perfessor.&#8221;</p>

<p>My goodness! the pow-wow! But they skedaddled
just the same. Then I turned to Long-hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217; little game is over,&#8221; I begun. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t flimflam this gal another minute. You
don&#8217;t bum offen her fer another meal. You don&#8217;t
give her no more of that Patty song-and-dance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Macie come at me. &#8220;Alec! that&#8217;s insultin&#8217;,&#8221;
she says.</p>

<p>The Perfessor starts a-gabblin&#8217;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8220;Hole you&#8217; hosses,&#8221; I says. &#8220;You knowed <i>all</i>
the time that the impressyroa wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
show up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sewell, this is <i>too</i> much,&#8221; says Long-hair,
clawin&#8217; at his mane.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s more a-comin&#8217;,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Macie, I
was shore somethin&#8217; was skew-gee about this
mealy-mouth here, so I had a talk with that
Seenyer this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>That give Long-hair a jolt. &#8220;Impossible!&#8221;
he yells; &#8220;the secretaries<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They <i>was</i> about eight, not to mention some
office kids,&#8221; I says; &#8220;but when I give &#8217;em some
straight ole Oklahomaw, I went in O. K.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long-hair backed off, plumb kaflummuxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Seenyer said he&#8217;d heerd of this gent,&#8221; I
goes on, &#8220;and wouldn&#8217;t let him learn a <i>cow</i> of
hisn to sing. Friend? any little favour? come
here? <i>Nixey.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I walks over to him. &#8220;Acknowledge the corn,
you polecat,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>He seen the jig was up. But he made his bluff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Sewell, this coarse feller<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Macie cut in. &#8220;It&#8217;s all so,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
put me off and <i>put</i> me off. All my money&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
gone. I&#8217;d banked on t&#8217;-night. And now&#8211;what
am I goin&#8217; to do!&#8221; She dropped on to a chair,
her face in her hands again.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pore little gal!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sit up. &#8220;No, Alec,&#8221; she says, &#8220;I <i>ain&#8217;t</i>
pore. I&#8217;ve got you, and the best paw a gal <i>ever</i>
had, and my home&#8211;aw, the <i>dear</i> ole Bar Y!
And, Alec, I&#8217;m goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; where, little gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>She come over and stood in front of me, and
put her two hands on my arm. &#8220;Alec,&#8221; she says,
tears and smiles all to oncet, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; start
home to Oklahomaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Start home to Oklahomaw&#8221;&#8211;them words
made me think, of a suddent, about what Billy &#8217;d
said t&#8217; me at the train. I reached into my inside
coat-pocket. &#8220;Wait, little gal,&#8221; I says, &#8220;we must
read <i>this</i> first. It&#8217;s that other letter of Up-State&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened it, her fingers all thumbs, she was
so <i>ex</i>cited. And standin&#8217; there byside me, with
the Perfessor a-watchin&#8217; us from a corner, she
begun:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>&#8216;Dear Alec Lloyd<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></i>&#8217;Why, it ain&#8217;t fer <i>me,</i>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Alec Lloyd, you&#8217;ll git this after Macie&#8217;s
gone to Noo York. Alec, you know now
the trip was needful. Do you think you could
&#8217;a&#8217; helt her if she didn&#8217;t have her try? Mebbe.
But you wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been happy. All her life
she &#8217;d &#8217;a felt sore about that career she give up,
and been longin&#8217; and longin&#8217;.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And, Macie, &#8217;cause you&#8217;ll read this, too&#8211;now

hole it agin me fer sayin&#8217; I knowed you wouldn&#8217;t
make no go of it. The op&#8217;ra game at its best is
a five-hunderd-to-one shot. A turrible big herd
plays it, the foreigners git the main prizes, and

but they&#8217;ll even things up by the way they&#8217;ll

<p>Mace peeked inside the envelope. &#8220;Why,
here&#8217;s a bill!&#8221; she says. &#8220;Alec!&#8221; And she
drawed it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bill?&#8221; I turned it over. &#8220;Why&#8211;why, it&#8217;s
fer five hunderd dollars! Macie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Long-Hair got up and started our way,
grinnin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>you</i> don&#8217;t git a cent of it,&#8221; I says,
turnin&#8217; on him quick.</p>

<p>He dodged.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d <i>better</i> be keerful,&#8221; I says. Then, to
Macie, &#8220;Honey, here&#8217;s another chanst t&#8217; make
a try. You can git a <i>good</i> teacher, <i>this</i> time&#8211;yas,
that&#8217;s what I said, Perfessor, <i>a good teacher</i>&#8211;and you&#8217;ll be the biggest singer in Amuricaw
<i>yet.</i>&#8221; And I helt the bill out to her.</p>

<p>The only answer she give was t&#8217; run to the
door and pull at one of them round thing-um-a-jigs
that brings a telegraph kid. Next, she come
back to a table, found a piece of paper and writ
somethin&#8217; on it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>&#8220;Here, Alec,&#8221; she says, &#8220;here. Read this.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Say!</span> wouldn&#8217;t you &#8217;a&#8217; figgered, after I&#8217;d brung
Mace back t&#8217; the ole Bar Y, and made her paw

and he had t&#8217; go streak up t&#8217; town and telephone
Kansas City fer a grand pyano and a talkin&#8217;-machine&#8211;now
<i>wouldn&#8217;t</i> you &#8217;a&#8217; figgered that he&#8217;d
&#8217;a&#8217; treated me A1 when I come to ast him fer the
little gal?</p>

<p>Wal,&#8211;listen t&#8217; this!</p>

<p>&#8217;Fore ever I spoke to him, I says to myself,
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t no use, when you want to start up a
mule, to git behind and push &#8217;r git in front and
pull. No, ma&#8217;am. The only way is to hunt a
pan of feed &#8217;r a pick-axe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Sewell&#8217;s shore one of them long-eared
critters&#8211;hardmouthed, and goin&#8217; ahaid like
blazes whenever you wanted him to come short;
then, again, balkin&#8217; till it&#8217;s a case of grandfather&#8217;s
clock, and you git to thinkin&#8217; that &#8217;fore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
he&#8217;ll move on he&#8217;ll plumb drop in his tracks. So
no drivin&#8217;. Coaxin&#8217; is good enough fer you&#8217;
friend Cupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first time I got a good chanst, I took in
my belt, spit on my hands, shassayed up to the
ole man, and sailed in&#8211;dead centre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; I begun, &#8220;some fellers marry &#8217;cause
they git plumb sick and tired of fastenin&#8217; they
suspenders with a nail, and some fellers
marry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal? wal? wal?&#8221; breaks in Sewell, offish
all of a suddent, and them little eyes of hisn
lookin&#8217; like two burnt holes in a blanket. &#8220;What
you drivin&#8217; at? Git it out. Time&#8217;s skurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Puttin&#8217; it flat-footed, then,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I come
to speak to you about my marryin&#8217; Macie.&#8221;</p>

<p>He throwed up his haid&#8211;same as a long-horn&#8217;ll
do when she&#8217;s scairt&#8211;and wrinkled his
forrid. Next, he begun to jingle his cash (<i>ba-a-ad</i>
sign). &#8220;So <i>that&#8217;s</i> what?&#8221; (He&#8217;d guessed as
much a&#8217;ready, I reckon.) &#8220;Wal,&#8211;I&#8217;m a-listenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I got a <i>turrible</i> rush of words to the
mouth, and put the case up to him right strong.
Said they was no question how I felt about Mace,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
and that this shore was a life-sentence fer me,
&#8217;cause I wasn&#8217;t the kind of a man to want to
ever slip my matreemonal hobbles. And I tacked
on that the little gal reckoned <i>she</i> knowed her
own mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;No gal ever <i>lived</i> that knowed her own
mind,&#8221; puts in Sewell, snappy as the dickens,
and actin&#8217; powerful oneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mace ain&#8217;t the usual brand,&#8221; I says.
&#8220;She&#8217;s got a good haid&#8211;a <i>fine</i> haid. She&#8217;s like
<i>you,</i> Sewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can keep you&#8217; compliments to home,&#8221;
says the boss. Then, after a little bit, &#8220;S&#8217;pose
you been plannin&#8217; a&#8217;ready where you&#8217;d settle.&#8221;
(This sorta inquirin&#8217;.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-a-as,&#8221; I says, &#8220;we&#8217;ve talked some of that
little house in Briggs City which Doc Trowbridge
lets&#8211;the one over to the left of the
tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>That second, I seen a look come over his face
that made me plumb goose-flesh. It was the
sorta look that a&#8217; ole bear gives you when you&#8217;ve
got him hurt and into a corner&#8211;some appealin&#8217;,
y&#8217; savvy, and a hull lot mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; I says to myself, &#8220;I put my foot in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
it when I brung up Billy&#8217;s name. Sewell recollects
the time I stuck in my lip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You plan t&#8217; live in Briggs,&#8221; he says. He
squz his lips t&#8217;gether, and turned his face towards
the ranch-house. Mace was inside, goin&#8217;
back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards &#8217;twixt the dinin&#8217;-room
and the kitchen. She looked awful cute and
pretty from where we was, and was callin&#8217; sassy
things to the Chinaman. Sewell watched her and
watched her, and I <i>re</i>called later on (when I
wasn&#8217;t so all-fired anxious and <i>ex</i>cited), that
the ole man&#8217;s face was some white, and he was
kinda all lent over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-a-as,&#8221; I continues (some trembley,
though), &#8220;that place of Billy&#8217;s &#8217;d suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two seconds, and Sewell come round on me
like as if he&#8217;d chaw me into bits. &#8220;What you
goin&#8217; to rent on?&#8221; he ast. &#8220;What you goin&#8217; to
live on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; I answers, sorta took back, &#8220;I got
about three hunderd dollars left of the money
Up-State give me. Wal, that&#8217;s my nest-aig.
And I can make my little forty a month&#8211;<i>and</i>
grub&#8211;<i>any</i> ole day in the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sewell drawed his breath in, deep. (Look out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
when a man takes up air that-a-way: Somethin&#8217;s
shore a-comin&#8217;!) &#8220;Forty a month!&#8221; he says.
&#8220;Forty a month! That just about keeps you in
ca&#8217;tridges! Forty a month!&#8211;and you without a
square foot of land, &#8217;r a single, solitary horned
critter, &#8217;r more&#8217;n a&#8217; Injun&#8217;s soogin&#8217; &#8217;twixt you
and the floor! Do y&#8217; think you can take that little
baby gal of mine into a blank shack that ain&#8217;t
got a stick of anythin&#8217; in it, and turn her loose
of a Monday, like a Chink, to do the wash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ease up, boss,&#8221; I says. &#8220;I reckon I
think <i>al</i>most as much of Mace as you do. And
I&#8217;m figgerin&#8217; to make her life just as happy as
I <i>can.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, then he walked up and down, up and
down (this all happened out by the calf-corral),
and blowed and blowed and blowed. Said that
him and his daughters had allus made the Bar
Y ranch-house seem like home to the Sewell
punchers, and they was men in the outfit just
low-down mean enough to take advantage of it.
Said he&#8217;d raised his gal like a lady&#8211;and now
she was goin&#8217; to be treated like a squaw.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been any other ole man but Mace&#8217;s,
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; made him swaller ev&#8217;ry one of them words
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
&#8217;fore ever he got &#8217;em out. As it stood, a-course,
I couldn&#8217;t. So I just helt my lip till he was over
his holler. (By now, y&#8217; savvy, I&#8217;d went through
enough&#8211;from sayin&#8217; the wrong thing back when
Paw Sewell &#8217;r his daughter was a-talkin&#8217;&#8211;t&#8217;
learn me that the best <i>I</i> could do was just t&#8217; keep
my blamed mouth shut.)</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I says, &#8220;You spoke of land, Mister
Sewell,&#8221; I says, politer&#8217;n pie, and as cool as
if I had the hull of Oklahomaw up my sleeve.
(Been a beefsteak, y&#8217; savvy, fer him to git the
idear he had me anxious any.) &#8220;Wal, how much
land do you figger out that you&#8217; next son-in-law
oughta have?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked oneasy again, got red some, and
begun workin&#8217; his nose up and down like a rabbit.
&#8220;Aw, thunder!&#8221; he says, &#8220;what you astin&#8217;
<i>that</i> fer? A man&#8211;<i>any</i> man&#8211;when he marries,
oughta have a place big enough so&#8217;s his chickens
can kick up the dirt &#8217;round his house without its
fallin&#8217; into somebody else&#8217;s yard. Out here, where
the hull blamed country&#8217;s land&#8211;just land fer
miles&#8211;a man oughta have a piece, say&#8211;wal, as
big as&#8211;as that Andrews chunk of mine.&#8221; (When
Billy married Rose, Sewell bought over the Andrews&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
ranch, y&#8217; savvy. Wanted it &#8217;cause it laid
&#8217;twixt hisn and town, and had a fine water-hole
fer the stock. But a good share of the hunderd
acres in it wasn&#8217;t much to brag on&#8211;just crick-bottom.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The Andrews place?&#8221; I says, smooth and
easy. &#8220;Wal, Sewell, I&#8217;ll keep that in mind. And,
now, you spoke of cows<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty &#8217;r so,&#8221; puts in the ole man, quick, like
as if he was &#8217;shamed of hisself. (His ranges is
plumb <i>alive</i> with cattle.) &#8220;A start, Cupid,&#8211;just
a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wal, a-course, whatever he said went with <i>me</i>.
If he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; <i>ad</i>vised walkin&#8217; on my hands as far
as Albuquerque, you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; saw me a-startin&#8217;,
spurs in the air!</p>

<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; I says then, and walked off. When
I turned round, a little bit later, Sewell was
standin&#8217; there yet, haid down, shoulders hunched
over, arms a-hangin&#8217; loose at his sides, and all
his fingers twitchin&#8217;. As I clumb on to that pinto
bronc of mine and steered her outen the gate, I
couldn&#8217;t help but think that, all of a suddent,
seems like, the boss looked a mighty lot <i>older</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maud,&#8221; I says, as I loped fer town, &#8220;Maud,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
I&#8217;m shore feazed! I been believin&#8217;, since I got
back from Noo York, that it was settled I was
to marry Mace. And here, if I don&#8217;t watch out,
that Injun-giver&#8217;ll take her back. I was a
blamed idjit to give him any love-talk. The only
thing he cares fer is money&#8211;money!&#8221; Wal,
some men &#8217;re like that&#8211;and tighter&#8217;n a wood-tick.
When they go to pay out a dollar, they
hole on to it so hard they plumb pull it outen
shape, yas, ma&#8217;am. Why, I can recollect seein&#8217;
dollars that looked like the handle of a jack-knife.</p>

<p>But if I was brash in front of Sewell, I caved
in all right when I got to Briggs City. Say! did
you ever have the blues&#8211;so bad you didn&#8217;t want
to eat, and you didn&#8217;t want to talk, and you
didn&#8217;t want to drink, but just wanted to lay,
nose in the pilla, and think and think and think?
Wal, fer three days, that was me!</p>

<p>And I was still sullin&#8217; when Sheriff Bergin
come stompin&#8217; in with a copy of the Goldstone
<i>Tarantula</i>. &#8220;Here&#8217;s bum luck!&#8221; he growls.
&#8220;A-course <i>Briggs</i> couldn&#8217;t hump herself none;
but that jay town down the line has to go have
a boom.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>&#8220;A boom?&#8221; I says, settin&#8217; up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reg&#8217;lar rip-snorter of a Kansas boom.
Some Chicago fellers with a lot of cash has
turned up and is a-buyin&#8217; in all the sand.
Wouldn&#8217;t it make y&#8217; <i>sick?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I reached fer that paper with both fists. Yas,
there it was&#8211;a piece about so long. &#8220;<i>Goldstone
offers the chanst of a lifetime,</i>&#8221; it read. &#8220;<i>Now
is when a little money&#8217;ll make a pile. Land is
cheap t&#8217;-day, but later on it&#8217;ll bring a big price.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I got on to my feet. They was about a quarter
of a&#8217; inch of stubble on my face, and I was
as shaky as a quakin&#8217; asp. But I had my spunk
up again. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I got a little money,&#8221; I says,
&#8220;&#8211;that nest-aig? Wal, I&#8217;ll just drop down to
Goldstone, and, if that boom is bony fido, and
growin&#8217;, <i>I&#8217;ll git in on it.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Next mornin&#8217;, I went over to the deepot, borraed
some paper from the agent, and writ Mace
a note. &#8220;<i>Little gal,</i>&#8221; I says in the letter, &#8220;<i>don&#8217;t
you go back on me. I&#8217;m prepared to work my
fingers down to the first knuckle fer you, and it&#8217;s
only right you&#8217; paw should want you took care
of good.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Number 201 come in and I hopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
abroad. &#8220;It&#8217;s land &#8217;r no lady,&#8221; I says to myself,
puttin&#8217; my little post-card photo of Macie into
my pocket as the train pulled out; &#8220;&#8211;land &#8217;r no
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when I hit Goldstone, I plumb got the
heart-disease. The same ole long street was
facin&#8217; the track; the same scatterin&#8217; houses was
standin&#8217; to the north and south; and the same
bunch of dobe shacks was over towards the
east, where the greasers lived. The town wasn&#8217;t
changed none!</p>

<p>Another minute, and I felt more chipper.
West of town, two &#8217;r three fellers was walkin&#8217;
&#8217;round, stakin&#8217; out the mesquite. And nigh the
station, &#8217;twixt them and me, was a brand-new,
hip-roofed shanty with a long black-and-white
sign acrosst it. The sign said &#8220;Real Estate.&#8221;
Wal, <i>that</i> looked like <i>business!</i></p>

<p>I bulged in. They was a&#8217; awful dudey feller
inside, settin&#8217; at a table and makin&#8217; chicken-tracks
on a big sheet of blue paper. &#8220;Howdy,&#8221;
I says, &#8220;you must be one of them Chicago
gents?&#8221;</p>

<p>He jumped up and shook hands. &#8220;Yas, I am,&#8221;
he says; &#8220;but only a land-agent, y&#8217; savvy. They&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
three others in town that&#8217;s got <i>capital</i>. The one
that lives over yonder at the hotel is a millionaire.
Then they&#8217;s a doctor (left a <i>fine</i> practice to
come), and a preacher. But the preacher ain&#8217;t
just one of you&#8217; <i>ord&#8217;nary</i> pulpit pounders.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stooped over to git a look at that sheet of
blue paper. It had lines all criss-cross on it, same
as a checker-board, and little, square, white spots
showin&#8217; now and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ex</i>cuse me fer astin&#8217;,&#8221; I says, &#8220;but what&#8217;s
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the new map of Goldstone,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;and drawed two mile square. Here&#8221;&#8211;pointin&#8217;
to a white spot&#8211;&#8220;&#8217;ll be the Normal College, and
here&#8221;&#8211;pointin&#8217; to another&#8211;&#8220;the Merchants&#8217;
<i>Ex</i>change. Then, a-course, the Pavilion fer Indus&#8217;tral
<i>Ex</i>hibitions<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardner,&#8221; I broke in, &#8220;if Goldstone was in
the middle &#8217;r east part of Oklahomaw, where
crops is allus fine, this boom wouldn&#8217;t surprise
me a <i>little</i> bit. But out <i>this</i> way, where they&#8217;s
only a show fer cattle, I cain&#8217;t just understand
it. Now, they must be some <i>reason.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The real estate agent, he smiled awful sly
like, and wunk. &#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>Later on, I seen the gent that was stoppin&#8217; at
the hotel. He was tonier&#8217;n the other. Wore
one of them knee coats that&#8217;s got a wedge outen
it, right in front, and two buttons fastened in
the small of the back. He was walkin&#8217; up and
down the porch and smokin&#8217; a seegar. Rich?
Wal, I guess! Had the finest room in the house,
and et three six-bit meals a day! About fifty, he
was, and kinda porky; not a tub, y&#8217; savvy, but
plenty fat.</p>

<p>That same day, a new <i>Tarantula</i> come out.
In it was a piece haided &#8220;<i>More Capital Fer
Goldstone.</i>&#8221; It went on like this: &#8220;<i>Our City has
lately acquired four new citizens whose confidence
and belief in her future &#8217;d put some of
the old hangers-on and whiners to the blush if
they faces wasn&#8217;t made of brass, and didn&#8217;t know
how to blush. Wake up,</i>&#8221; goes on the <i>Tarantula,
&#8220;wake up, Goldstone, and shake you&#8217;self. And
gents, here&#8217;s a hearty welcome! Give us you&#8217;
paw!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Goldstone was woke up, all right, all right.
She was as lively and <i>ex</i>cited as a chicken with
its haid cut off. That real-estate feller &#8217;d bought
up two big tracts just north of town, gittin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
&#8217;em cheap a-course; <i>awful</i> cheap, in fact,
&#8217;cause no one &#8217;d smelt a boom when he
first showed up. (Wal, <i>first</i> come, first <i>served</i>.)
Porky &#8217;d bought, too, and owned some lots
&#8217;twixt them tracts and the post-office. To the
east, right where the nicest houses is, the parson
was plannin&#8217; to import his fambly. More&#8217;n that,
them four gun-shy gents stood ready to buy
all the time. And Goldstone fellers that would
&#8217;a&#8217; swapped they lots fer a yalla dawg, and then
shot the dawg, was holdin&#8217; out fer fifty plunks.</p>

<p>Wal, I had that three hunderd. But I helt
back. What I wanted to know was <i>the why behind
the boom.</i></p>

<p>I just kinda happened past that real-estate
corn-crib. The land-agent was to home, and
I ast him to come over and have one with me.
He said O. K., that suited <i>him</i>. So we greased
our hollers a few times. And, when he was feelin&#8217;
so good that he could make out to talk, I drawed
from him that Goldstone was likely to stand
&#8217;way up yonder at the haid of her class account
of &#8220;natu&#8217;al developments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Natu&#8217;al developments,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Wal,
pardner, when it comes to them big, dictionary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
words, I shore am a slouch. And you got me all
twisted up in my picket-rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had to spend another dollar &#8217;fore he&#8217;d
talk some more. Then he begun, <i>turrible</i> confidential:
&#8220;I been sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; and sawin&#8217; wood,
Lloyd. I ain&#8217;t let <i>no</i> man git information outen
<i>me</i>. But I like you, Lloyd, and, say! I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217;
to tell you. Natu&#8217;al developments is <i>coal</i> and <i>oil</i>
and <i>gas.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Same as the Tusla country! Wal, I was plumb
crazy. &#8220;Blamed if it ain&#8217;t <i>likely,</i>&#8221; I says to myself.
&#8220;Wal, that settles things fer <i>me.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I got shet of that real-estate feller quick as
I could (didn&#8217;t want him to remember that he&#8217;d
talked in his sleep), and hunted up the post-master.
The postmaster was one of the china-eyed,
corn-silk Swedes, and he owned quite a bit
of Goldstone. I tole him I wanted to buy a
couple of lots &#8217;cause I was goin&#8217; to be married,
and figgered to build. (That wasn&#8217;t no lie,
neither.) Said I didn&#8217;t want to live in the part
of town where the greasers was fer the reason
that I&#8217;d rather settle down in a Sioux Camp in
August <i>any</i> day than amongst a crowd of blamed
<i>cholos</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>The postmaster wasn&#8217;t anxious to sell. Said
he didn&#8217;t have more&#8217;n a block left, and he wanted
a big price fer that. &#8220;&#8217;Cause this boom is <i>solid,</i>&#8221;&#8211;he kinda half whispered it. &#8220;How do I know?
Wal, I pumped one of them suspender-cityzens
this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>That showed me I&#8217;d got to hump myself. If
that real-estate feller blabbed any more, I
wouldn&#8217;t be able to buy. The station-agent
owned some lots. I hiked fer the deepot.</p>

<p>When I looked into the ticket-office through
the little winda, I seen that agent&#8211;one hand
on the tick-machine, other holdin&#8217; his haid&#8211;with
his mouth wide open, like a hungry wall-eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lloyd,&#8221; he says, pantin&#8217; hard, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got
no right to tell, but I can&#8217;t hole it in. Them Chicago
fellers, Lloyd, are a Standard Oil bunch.
Look a-here!&#8221; And he pushed out a telegram.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; believed it if I hadn&#8217;t saw it
writ down in black and white. But there it was,
haided Chicago, addressed to Porky, and as plain
as day: &#8220;<i>Buy up all that&#8217;s possible. Price no
object. Rockafeller.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! I come nigh lettin&#8217; out a yell. Then,
knowin&#8217; they was no use to ast the agent to sell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
I split fer the liv&#8217;ry-stable. And when I got back
into town late that night, I&#8217;d been down to a
ranch below Goldstone and handed over my nest-aig
fer a quarter-section just south of town.</p>

<p>Next mornin&#8217;, they was a nice pile of stakes
throwed out on to that sand patch of mine, all
them stakes white on the one end and sharp on
the other. And they was a big sign onloaded, too.
Yas, ma&#8217;am. It said, &#8220;The Lloyd Addition.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that <i>same</i> noon, Number 201 brung me a
letter from little Macie!</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t cut up my quarter into lots straight
off. Made up my mind it&#8217;d be best to see that
real-estate feller first, ast his <i>ad</i>vice, and see if
he&#8217;d handle the property. So I made fer his
office in a <i>turrible</i> sweat.</p>

<p>Heerd awful loud talkin&#8217; as I come nigh, and
seen they was a big crowd &#8217;round the door. And
here was Porky and the parson, just <i>havin&#8217;</i> it&#8211;up and down!</p>

<p>&#8220;The idear!&#8221; the parson was sayin&#8217;, &#8220;&#8211;the
idear of you&#8217; thinkin&#8217; you can go stick a pavilion
where licker&#8217;ll be sold right next to the Cathedral!&#8221;
(He was madder &#8217;n all git out!)</p>

<p>Porky shrug his shoulders. &#8220;My dear <i>sir,</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
he says, &#8220;I got to use my own <i>land</i> in my own
<i>way.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw!&#8221; answers the parson, solemn, &#8220;&#8211;aw!
my friend, give you&#8217; heart a housecleanin&#8217;. Think
not so muchly about worldly <i>po</i>ssessions, but
<i>see</i>cure a lot in the New Jerusalem!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Porky flew up. Said the parson &#8217;d insulted
him. &#8220;And,&#8221; he almost yelled, &#8220;this is
how it stands. Either you got to buy the block
where the pavilion&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be, &#8217;r I&#8217;ll buy the
Cathedral property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got you&#8217; means at my command,&#8221;
says the parson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. I&#8217;ll take the church lots. Name
you&#8217; figger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Porky pulled out his check-book and begun to
scribble with one of them squirt-gun pens. &#8220;The
matter is settled,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>Say! the feller who&#8217;d sole that property to
the parson fer a hunderd&#8211;we had to prop him
up!</p>

<p>Just afterwards, I had my chin with the real-estate
dude, and I tell you it made me pretty
blue. &#8220;Sorry, Lloyd,&#8221; he says; &#8220;you know <i>I</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
never tole you to buy <i>south</i> of town. And I don&#8217;t
keer to bother with you&#8217; Addition. &#8217;Cause Goldstone
is goin&#8217; to grow to the north and east.&#8221;</p>

<p>Porky was there, and he said the very same
thing. And a few minutes later on, when the
doc come in, I couldn&#8217;t git him to even <i>con</i>sider
lookin&#8217; over my buy. But fer a lot on the north
side, belongin&#8217; to the parson, he put down the
good, hard <i>coin</i>.</p>

<p>North and east was the hull talk now, and them
Goldstone fellers who&#8217;d sole out cheap in that
end of town felt some pale. But the Chicago
gents was as pert as prairie-dawgs, and doin&#8217; a
thunderin&#8217; lot of buyin&#8217;. Now, the doc owned
sev&#8217;ral lots east of Porky&#8217;s tract. &#8220;New drug-store
here,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and a fine town hall over
it. I&#8217;ll put ten thousand into the buildin&#8217;.&#8221; And
the parson bought next to the site fer the Normal
College. &#8220;The city,&#8221; he says, &#8220;&#8217;ll want a spot
fer its High School.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the time this was goin&#8217; on, I was livin&#8217; on
nothin&#8217;, you might say, and not even spendin&#8217;
a cent fer a shave. My haid had a crop of hay
on it that would &#8217;a&#8217; filled a pilla; I had a Santy
Claus beard, and if I couldn&#8217;t afford to grub at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
the hotel, I wasn&#8217;t mean enough to use they
soap. So, far as looks goes, I was some changed.</p>

<p>Then&#8211;the <i>Tarantula</i> showed up with the hull
story about coal and oil and gas! Say! the cat
was outen the bag. And Goldstone come nigh
havin&#8217; a fit and fallin&#8217; in. Here it&#8217;d been over
a gold-mine, and didn&#8217;t know it! And here it&#8217;d
gone and sole itself out to a passel of strange
ducks!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Feller citizens,</i>&#8221; says the paper, &#8220;<i>this beautiful
city of yourn is destined to rival South McAlester
and Colgate.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>That was on a Thursday, if I recollect right.
Wal, say! fer the next two days, more things
happened in that there town than&#8217;d ever happened
in the hull <i>county</i> afore. Ev&#8217;rybody that
could rake, scrape, beg &#8217;r borra was a-doin&#8217; it&#8211;so&#8217;s they could buy. Friday, the postmaster
got a big block from the real-estate gent; same
day, kinda as a favour, the doc sold the ticket-agent
two &#8217;r three lots. I felt blamed sore &#8217;cause <i>I</i>
didn&#8217;t have no money to git in on some good deals.
But I hung on to the &#8220;Lloyd Addition&#8221;&#8211;I
wouldn&#8217;t let <i>that</i> git outen my hands. Aw, I
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to lie&#8211;I had the boom-fever bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
as <i>any</i>body. Fact is, I had it <i>worse</i>. And who
wouldn&#8217;t&#8211;when gettin&#8217; that little gal depended
on it?</p>

<p>Saturday, Goldstone went plumb crazy. They
was buyin&#8217; and sellin&#8217; back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards,
this way and that way, in circles and cater-corners.
From sun-up on, that real-estate shanty had
half a dozen fellers in it all the time; more was
over to the hotel, dickerin&#8217; with Porky; and a
lot of others trailed up the parson and the doc.
Nobody et &#8217;cause they was too blamed <i>ex</i>cited.
Nobody drunk &#8217;cause they wouldn&#8217;t spare the
cash. The sun went down, and they kept on
a-buyin&#8217;. And at midnight, the town went to
bed&#8211;<i>rich!</i></p>

<p>The day afterwards was Sunday. And I hope
I may die if I ever fergit that Sunday!</p>

<p>When the sun come up, as a story-book&#8217;d
put it, Goldstone lay as calm and peaceful as a
babe, &#8217;cept where some poor devil of a cow-punch
was gittin&#8217; along towards his bunk when
he oughta been comin&#8217; outen it. But all else was
O. K. Weather fine, ev&#8217;rybody well, thank y&#8217;,
and land so high it&#8217;s a wonder the temper&#8217;ture
wasn&#8217;t gittin&#8217; low.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>But ain&#8217;t it funny how quick things can
change?</p>

<p>First off, some of us boys went over to that
real-estate hogan&#8211;and found the door open and
the place stripped. Yas, ma&#8217;am; duds gone, pictures
gone. Only the bench and the table left.</p>

<p>&#8220;What struck <i>him?</i>&#8221; ast the postmaster, who
was comin&#8217; by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; says a feller, careless, &#8220;&#8211;I guess
he&#8217;s moved into a better office, mebbe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; agrees the postmaster. Then, his
voice gittin&#8217; holler, like, &#8220;But ain&#8217;t that the map
of Goldstone, with a rip in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was&#8211;tore clean in two!</p>

<p>We wasn&#8217;t anxious any. Just the same, we
drifted over to the hotel. When we got to the
door, we met the clerk comin&#8217; out. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
you&#8217; millionaire friend this mornin&#8217;?&#8221; we ast
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Started fer Chicago last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8211;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone to raise more capital, I guess,&#8221; says
the clerk. &#8220;&#8217;Cause he didn&#8217;t settle&#8211;is comin&#8217;
back right off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without nobody sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; more, we all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
made up the street to the doctor&#8217;s, the crowd
growin&#8217; as we went along. Even after bein&#8217;
knocked plumb flat with a sledge-hammer, we
didn&#8217;t know <i>yet</i> what&#8217;d bit us. But they was another
whopper a-comin&#8217;&#8211;the <i>doc</i> wasn&#8217;t to be
found.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; says the postmaster, swallerin&#8217; hard,
&#8220;that if we ast the parson<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Up pipes a kid. &#8220;The parson wasn&#8217;t to Sunday
school this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fer a spell, we all just looked at each other.
Then, the <i>pro</i>cession formed and moved east&#8211;towards
the parson&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A square table was inside. On it was a lot of
bottles and glasses and a pack of cards&#8211;nothin&#8217;
more.</p>

<p>Ole sin-killer, too!</p>

<p>I spoke up: &#8220;They&#8217;s gone, boys,&#8211;but what
about they <i>land?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; answers one feller, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
the doc <i>had</i> none. &#8217;Cause I bought the Merchants&#8217;
<i>Ex</i>change site offen him yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I bought the Normal School block offen
the parson,&#8221; says Number Two.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what I got from the real-estate feller
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
last night,&#8221; adds the hotel clerk, &#8220;must &#8217;a&#8217; come
nigh to cleanin&#8217; <i>him</i> out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another spell of quiet. Then<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; <i>re</i>marks the station-agent, &#8220;if
that Rockafeller telegram was <i>genuwine.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The postmaster throwed up his hands. &#8220;We&#8217;re
it!&#8221; he says. &#8220;We sole our sand fer a song, and
we bought it back at a steep figger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all that money,&#8221; adds the hotel clerk,
&#8220;they must &#8217;a&#8217; had to walk bow-laigged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; says the station-agent, &#8220;the
drinks is on us!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>And me? Wal, I wandered &#8217;round fer a while&#8211;like I was plumb loco. When I landed up at
last, I seen somethin&#8217; white in front of me. It
was a sign, and it said, &#8220;The Lloyd Addition.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sit down on my little pile of stakes, and
pulled out the last letter I&#8217;d got from Macie.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Alec,&#8221; it begun, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you got
you&#8217; land<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></i>&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>I didn&#8217;t read no further. I looked off acrosst
the mesquite in the <i>di</i>rection of Briggs City.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
&#8220;The land ain&#8217;t no good,&#8221; I says. &#8220;And all my
money&#8217;s gone.&#8221; And I laid my haid down on my
arms.</p>

<p>Just then, outen a bunch of grass not far off,
I heerd the spunky little song of a lark!</p>

<p>I riz up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; I says, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; home. Mebbe
I look like a bum; but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back where I
got some friends! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back where they
call me Cupid!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER TWELVE<br /><span class='h2fs'>AND A BOOM AT BRIGGS</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>I got</span> back all right. It takes two dollars and
six-bits to git from Goldstone to Briggs City
on the Local. But if you happen to have a little
flat bottle in you&#8217; back pocket, you ride in the
freight caboose fer nothin&#8217;. I <i>had</i> a flat bottle.
I swapped &#8220;The Lloyd Addition&#8221; fer it.</p>

<p>When I hit ole Briggs City, she looked all
right t&#8217; <i>me,</i> I can tell y&#8217;. And so did the boys.
And by noon I was plumb wored out, I&#8217;d gassed
so much.</p>

<p>Wal, I went over and sit down on the edge of
Silverstein&#8217;s porch to rest my face and hands.
Pretty soon, I heerd a hoss a-comin&#8217; up the street&#8211;<i>clickety, clickety, clickety, click.</i> It stopped at
the post-office, right next me. I looked up&#8211;and
here was Macie!</p>

<p>Say! I felt turrible, &#8217;cause I hadn&#8217;t slicked up
any yet. But she didn&#8217;t seem to notice. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
knowed they was somethin&#8217; gone wrong though,
&#8217;fore ever I said a word. She just helt out one
soft little hand. &#8220;Never you mind, Alec,&#8221; she
says; &#8220;never you mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>My little gal!</p>

<p>&#8220;It means punchin&#8217; cows fer four years at
forty per, Macie,&#8221; I says to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait fer you, Alec,&#8221; she answers.</p>

<p>She&#8217;d gone, and I was turnin&#8217; back towards
Silverstein&#8217;s, when&#8211;I&#8217;m a son-of-a-gun if I
didn&#8217;t see, a-comin&#8217; acrosst from the deepot, one
of them land-sharks! It was Porky, with that
wedge-coat of hisn, and a seegar as big as a
corn-cob!</p>

<p>Say! I duv under the porch so quick that I
clean scairt the life outen six razorbacks and
seventeen hens that was diggin&#8217; &#8217;round under it.
And when I come out where the back door is, I
skun fer Hairoil Johnson&#8217;s shack to borra a dif-f&#8217;rent
suit of clothes offen the parson. Next, I
had my Santy Claus mowed at the barber-shop.</p>

<p>But, when I looked in the glass, I wasn&#8217;t satisfied,
&#8217;cause I wasn&#8217;t changed enough. &#8220;What&#8217;ll
I <i>do?</i>&#8221; I ast the barber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wash,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>Wal, I&#8217;ll be dog-goned!&#8211;the <i>dis</i>guise was
complete!</p>

<p>Just then, in come Hank Shackleton.
&#8220;Hank,&#8221; I says, &#8220;what do y&#8217; think?&#8211;that fat
Chicago millionaire I was a-tellin&#8217; you of is
<i>here!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221; he answers, beginnin&#8217;
to grin. &#8220;That shore <i>is</i> luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; ast the barber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I says, &#8220;just think what we can <i>do</i>
to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hank just lent back and haw-hawed like he&#8217;d
bust his buttons off. &#8220;Aw, <i>don&#8217;t</i> make me
laugh,&#8221; he says; &#8220;my lip&#8217;s cracked!&#8221;</p>

<p>They ain&#8217;t no use talkin&#8217;&#8211;we fixed up a proposition
that was a <i>daisy</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;ll work like yeast,&#8221; says Shackleton.
&#8220;A-course, whatever <i>I</i> make outen it, Cupid, you
git a draw-down on&#8211;yas, you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody from Goldstone&#8217;ll speak up and
spoil the fun, neither,&#8221; I says. &#8220;Not by a jugful!
That passel of yaps down there is jealous
of Briggs, and &#8217;d just <i>like</i> to see her done.
What&#8217;s more, they got a heap of little, mean
pride, and &#8217;d never own up <i>they</i> been sold.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>It was shore funny, but from that <i>very</i> minute,
and all by <i>itself</i> kinda, Briggs City begun
to boom! Billy Trowbridge put a barb-wire fence
&#8217;round a couple of vacant lots next his house.
Bergin dug a big hole behind that ole vacant
shack of hisn, and buried about a ton of tin cans.
Hairoil turned some shoats into a rock patch he
owned and cleaned out the rattlesnakes. And all
over town, sand got five times as high as it&#8217;d
ever been afore.</p>

<p>So when my dudey friend, the real-estate feller,
struck our flourishin&#8217; city, and hired a&#8217; empty
shanty fer his office, he didn&#8217;t find no one anxious
to sell him a slice of land. &#8220;Say! property&#8217;s
up here,&#8221; he <i>re</i>marked, whilst he put down
the stiff price that Bill Rawson &#8217;d ast fer a lot.
He seemed sorta bothered in his mind. (But he
had to have land&#8211;to start his game on.)</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>climbin&#8217;,</i>&#8221; says Bill, pocketin&#8217; the spondulix.
(Later on, Bill says to <i>me,</i> &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
a-goin&#8217; to do another lick of hard work this
year!&#8221;)</p>

<p>Same day, here was Sam Barnes, walkin&#8217; up
and down on that acre of hisn and holdin&#8217; to a
forked stick. Wouldn&#8217;t tell Porky <i>why,</i> though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
he hinted that whenever a forked stick dipped
<i>three</i> times, <i>it meant somethin&#8217; more &#8217;n water.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t got the cash to do no investigatin&#8217;,&#8221;
says Sam, sad-like.</p>

<p>Porky got turrible inter<i>est</i>ed. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he says
t&#8217; Shackleton, &#8220;what you think of that land
of Barnes&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; answers Hank, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell y&#8217;: Oncet
I seen another strip that looked <i>just</i> like hisn
on top. And it was rich in gold. It was so blamed
rich in the colour that when the feller who owned
it (he was as lazy as a government mule)&#8211;when
that feller wanted more t&#8217;bacca, &#8217;r some spuds,
&#8217;r a piece of pig, why, he&#8217;d just go out into the
yard and roll. Then he&#8217;d hike to town, and when
he&#8217;d get into the bank, he&#8217;d shake hisself&#8211;good&#8211;pick up what fell to the floor, git it weighed,
and the payin&#8217;-teller would hand him out what
was comin&#8217; t&#8217; him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Porky peeled his eyes. (It was plain he didn&#8217;t
swaller it all.) But, after talkin&#8217; with that real-estate
feller, he hunted up Sam and bought
ev&#8217;ry square inch he had. &#8220;&#8217;Cause it&#8217;s dollars
to doughnuts,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that Briggs City&#8217;ll
grow this way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>&#8220;Wal, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; says Sam. &#8220;Bergin is
powerful strong in pollytics, and he figgers to
git the Court House <i>er</i>ected on the other side
of town&#8211;where his wife&#8217;s got some land.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new parson and the doc showed up that
same afternoon. And I reckon they liked that
Court House idear, &#8217;cause they took the north
half of the Starvation Gap property straight
off.</p>

<p>&#8220;The City Park,&#8221; they says, &#8220;should allus
be next the public buildin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The City Park,&#8221; says Buckshot Milliken,
&#8220;will likely be further north, right agin the
University. I <i>know</i>&#8211;fer the reason that they
was a meetin&#8217; of the University <i>di</i>rectors last
night. Then, the Farmers&#8217; and Merchants&#8217; Bank
is goin&#8217; to be located facin&#8217; the Park, and so is
the Grand Op&#8217;ra House.&#8221;</p>

<p>Porky gave Buckshot a&#8217; awful sharp look. But
Buckshot&#8217;s a&#8217; Injun when it comes to actin&#8217; innocenter&#8217;n
a kitten. So then the millionaire gent
looked <i>tickled</i> (&#8217;cause, just think!&#8211;if we was
<i>ex</i>cited a&#8217;ready about a boom, what a pile of
trouble it&#8217;d save him and his pardners!) Wal, he
waddled off and hunted &#8217;em up. And that night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
they pur<i>chased</i> &#8217;most all of them north lots&#8211;payin&#8217;
good.</p>

<p>It was the next mornin&#8217; that they got holt of
ole man Sewell and bought the Andrews place.
Sewell wasn&#8217;t <i>on</i>&#8211;he hadn&#8217;t been into town since
I come from Goldstone. But the real-estate gent
was used to puttin&#8217; up a good figger by now, and
the boss made a fair haul.</p>

<p>Right off, the Andrews chunk was laid out
in fifty-foot lots. It was just rows and <i>rows</i> of
white stakes, and when the West-bound was
stopped at the deepot fer grub, I seen Bill Rawson
pointin&#8217; them stakes out to two poor ole
white-haired women. &#8220;Ladies,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that&#8217;s
the battlefield where Crook fit the Kiowas.
Ev&#8217;ry stake&#8217;s a stiff.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the train pulled out, she was tipped all to
one side kinda, and runnin&#8217; on her off wheels,
&#8217;cause the pass&#8217;ngers was herded along the west
side of the cars, lookin&#8217; at that big graveyard.</p>

<p>When Hank&#8217;s next <i>Eye-Opener</i> come out, one
hull side of it was covered with a map of Briggs
City&#8211;drawed three mile square, so&#8217;s to take
in what Mrs. Bergin had left. Under the map
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
it said, &#8220;<i>The left-hand cross marks the position
of the West Oklahomaw Observatory, which is
to be built on top of Rogers&#8217;s Butte, and the cross
in the Andrews Addition marks the spot where
the great Sanatarium&#8217;ll stand.</i>&#8221; (Say! it was
gittin&#8217; to be a cold day in Briggs when somebody
didn&#8217;t start a grand, new institootion!) &#8220;<i>Why,</i>&#8221;
goes on Shackleton, in that piece of hisn,
&#8220;<i>breathin&#8217; that fine crick-bottom air, and on a
plain diet&#8211;say, of bread and clabbered milk, a
sick person oughta git cured up easy, and a
healthy person oughta live more&#8217;n a hunderd
years.</i>&#8221; (Wal, as far as <i>I&#8217;</i>m concerned, if I had to
eat clabbered milk a hunderd years, I&#8217;d ruther
<i>die!</i>)</p>

<p>Next thing, two &#8217;r three of the boys got into
a reg&#8217;lar jawin&#8217;-match over some property.
Chub Flannagan wanted to start a new paper
called the <i>Rip-Saw</i>. Shackleton, a-course, didn&#8217;t
want he should. Right in front of that real-estate
feller&#8217;s, Chub drawed a gun on Hank.
And Monkey Mike had to interfere &#8217;twixt them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a right to do what I please on my own
land,&#8221; yells Chub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll buy you&#8217; blamed lots,&#8221; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
Shackleton, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t stand fer compytition.
Here, agent, what&#8217;s Chub&#8217;s block worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dude reckoned it was worth five hunderd.
And Shackleton dug down like a man!</p>

<p>The rest of us done a turrible lot of buyin&#8217;
and sellin&#8217; right after that&#8211;one to the other.
The sheriff sold to Sam Barnes (fer a chaw of
t&#8217;bacca); Bill Rawson, he sold to me (on tick);
Hairoil Johnson to Dutchy, and so forth. &#8217;R,
it&#8217;d be like this: &#8220;Bet you a lot I can jump the
furth&#8217;est.&#8221; &#8220;Bet you cain&#8217;t.&#8221; Then real estate &#8217;d
change hands, and the <i>Tarantula</i> &#8217;d talk about
&#8220;a lively market.&#8221;</p>

<p>A-course, the dude and Porky, and the doc
and the new parson was doin&#8217; some buyin&#8217;, too.
&#8217;Fore long, they owned all Bergin had, and
Shackleton&#8217;s, and Chub&#8217;s, and Rawson&#8217;s, and
Johnson&#8217;s, and mine. And they picked out a
place fer the Deef, Dumb, and Blind Asylum;
and named ole man Sewell fer President of the
Briggs City Pott&#8217;ry works.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>Pretty soon, havin&#8217; all the land they wanted,
they begun, steady by jerks, to sell each other,
notice of them sales appearin&#8217; in the <i>Eye-Opener</i>
at two-bits apiece. Next, they got to sellin&#8217;
faster. Then, it was dawg eat dawg. Lickin&#8217;
things into a&#8217; <i>ex</i>citin&#8217; pass, them lots of theirn
flew back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards till the air was plumb
full of sand. When the sun went down that
never-to-be-fergot evenin&#8217; (as the speaker allus
says at a <i>po</i>litical pow-wow), ole Briggs City was
the colour of mesquite. But the pockets of the
punchers was so chuck full that, as the hours
drug by, our growin&#8217; city got redder &#8217;n a section-house,
&#8217;cause the boys was busy paintin&#8217; it. (But
count <i>me</i> out&#8211;I had my draw-down, and I was
a-hangin&#8217; <i>on</i> to it.) Whilst over at the real-estate
shack, them gun-shy gents was havin&#8217; a
quiet, little business talk, gittin&#8217; ready fer they
onloadin&#8217; campaign next day.</p>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock, I stopped by they shebang
and knocked. When the door was opened, here
they all sit, makin&#8217; out more deeds &#8217;n you could
shake a stick at. I didn&#8217;t go in. I figgered I&#8217;d
be gittin&#8217; married soon; and no feller wants his
face spotted up like a Sioux chief&#8217;s on his weddin&#8217;
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gents,&#8221; I says, &#8220;the boys sent me over to
thank you all fer pur<i>chasin&#8217;</i> property hereabouts
in such a blamed gen&#8217;rous way. And it&#8217;s shore too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
bad that <i>they</i> feel they cain&#8217;t invest. But they
plan to wait a year, and buy in what you got
fer taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fer as long as you could count ten, not a&#8217; one
of &#8217;em said a word. Then the doc stood up.
&#8220;Who in thunder are <i>you?</i>&#8221; he ast, voice like a
frog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I answers, &#8220;don&#8217;t you recollect <i>me?</i>
I&#8217;m Cupid here; but, down at Goldstone, I was
the owner of the Lloyd Addition.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jumped like they&#8217;d been stuck with a
pin. &#8220;The Lloyd Addition!&#8221; they kinda hisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; I goes on. &#8220;So I reckon you realise
that it wouldn&#8217;t be no use fer Mister Real-Estate
Agent, here, to git three-sheets-in-the-wind, and
then let out his grand natu&#8217;al development secret;
&#8217;r fer our millionaire friend to go send hisself
a telegram from Rockafeller. Gent&#8217;s you&#8217;
little Briggs City boom is busted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Say! next minute the hull quartette of &#8217;em
was a-swearin&#8217; to oncet, so&#8217;s it sounded like a
tune&#8211;nigger chords and all.</p>

<p>Next, Porky begun a solo. Said if they hadn&#8217;t
all been plumb crazy, they&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; knowed they was
a screw loose in Briggs. And now here they was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
stripped cleaner&#8217;n a whistle by a set of ornery
cow-punchers<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>I cut him short. &#8220;We know how to cure a
dawg of suckin&#8217; aigs,&#8221; I says. &#8220;We give him all
he wants of &#8217;em&#8211;red hot. Wal, you gents had
the boom disease, and you had it bad. But I
reckon now you&#8217;ve got just about all the land
you can hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>They nodded they haids. It was a show-down,
and no mistake, and they was plumb offen they
high hoss. Blamed if I didn&#8217;t come nigh feelin&#8217;
sorry fer &#8217;em! But I goes on, &#8220;I&#8217;m feard you-all&#8217;re
<i>just</i> a little bit ongrateful to me&#8211;<i>con</i>sider-in&#8217;
that I come here t&#8217;-night to help y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help?&#8221; they says. (Quartette again.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yas. Don&#8217;t you think, about this time,
that Chicago &#8217;d look pretty good to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicago!&#8221; says Porky, low and wistful, like
he didn&#8217;t never expect to see the place again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And hittin&#8217; the ties, fer two dudes like the
agent, here, and the parson<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parson be hanged!&#8221; says the last named
gent, ugly as the dickens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;but you never can
tell what the boys&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span>The doc was standin&#8217; up. As I said that, he
come down kerplunk onto a bench, like as if a
spring &#8217;d give way in his laigs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lloyd,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we&#8211;we&#8211;we&#8217;re willin&#8217; to
go, but we ain&#8217;t got no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re what I&#8217;d call land-poor,&#8221; I says.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need four tickets&#8211;wal, now, you own that
Andrews chunk, don&#8217;t y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lloyd,&#8221; says the real-estate feller, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
got the dead wood on us, ole man.&#8221; He picked
up one of them deeds from the table. &#8220;Git us
the tickets,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and here&#8217;s the Andrews
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A up-freight goes by in twenty minutes,&#8221; I
says. And started fer the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lloyd!&#8221; calls Porky after me, &#8220;think you
could spare us a&#8217; extra twenty fer grub?&#8211;<i>you</i>
don&#8217;t want us to starve, Lloyd. And&#8211;and
mebbe you could use the rest of these deeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>I come back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty?&#8221; I says; &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it fifty fer
luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>They was tears in that fake parson&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;Lloyd,&#8221; he says, &#8220;if I really <i>was</i> a preacher,
I&#8217;d pick you fer a saved man.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span>Later on, when I walked into Dutchy&#8217;s thirst-parlour,
the boys was on hand, waitin&#8217; patient.
As they ketched sight of me, they hollered
some.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; I says, &#8220;this is where I stand
treat. But it ain&#8217;t licker this tune, <i>no,</i> ma&#8217;am;
I&#8217;m presentin&#8217; hunderd-foot lots.&#8221; So out I
drawed my little bunch of deeds and handed one
to each feller. Bergin got the Observatory site
and the City Park; Rawson, the University
grounds; Hairoil, the Farmers&#8217; and Merchants&#8217;
Bank block; Chub, the Court House; Sam
Barnes, the spot fer the Grand Op&#8217;ra House,
and Billy Trowbridge, the land fer the Deef,
Dumb and Blind Asylum. Then I slid.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, and my pinto bronc was a-kitin&#8217;
fer the Bar Y ranch-house. Turnin&#8217; in at the
gate, I seen a light in the sittin&#8217;-room winda. I
dropped the reins over Maud&#8217;s haid and hoofed
it up onto the porch. And inside, there was
Macie, a-settin&#8217; in her rocker in front of the
fire. On the other side was the President of the
Briggs City Pott&#8217;ry Works.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221; I says, as I shook hands with him,
&#8220;Boss, I&#8217;ve come fer you&#8217; little gal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314'></a>314</span>
Say! it took him quick, like a stitch in the side.
&#8220;Fer my gal?&#8221; he kinda stammers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, Alec,<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; she whispers to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sewell,&#8221; I goes on, &#8220;when I ast you fer her,
a while back, you said, &#8216;Git a piece of land as
big as the Andrews chunk.&#8217; Wal,&#8221; (I handed out
my deed) &#8220;would you mind lookin&#8217; at this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yourn!&#8221; The ole man put his hands to
his haid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also,&#8221; I says, rattlin&#8217; the little stack of
twenties in my right-hand britches pocket, &#8220;I&#8217;m
fixed t&#8217; git some cows; fifty &#8217;r so&#8211;a start, boss,
just a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you do it! Why, I&#8217;m plumb knocked
silly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217; ain&#8217;t the man to go back on you&#8217;
word, Sewell. I can take good keer of Mace
now&#8211;and I want to be friends with the man
that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be my paw.&#8221;</p>

<p>He begun to look at me, awful steady and
sober, and he looked and he looked&#8211;like as if
he hadn&#8217;t just savvied. Next, he sorta talked to
hisself. &#8220;My little Macie,&#8221; he kept sayin&#8217;; &#8220;my
little Macie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her arms &#8217;round him then, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>
clean broke down. &#8220;Aw, I <i>cain&#8217;t</i> lose my little
gal,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t keer anythin&#8217; about land
&#8217;r cattle. But Macie&#8211;she&#8217;s all I got left. <i>Don&#8217;t</i>
take her away from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was it! (And I&#8217;d said that all Sewell
keered fer was money.) &#8220;Boss,&#8221; I says, &#8220;you
mean you&#8217;d like us to live here&#8211;with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He come over to me, tremblin&#8217; like he had the
ague. &#8220;Would y&#8217;, Cupid?&#8221; he ast. &#8220;I&#8217;d never
interfere with you two none. <i>Would</i> y&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, daddy!&#8221; says Mace, holdin&#8217; to him
tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless you&#8217; heart, Sewell,&#8221; I answers,
&#8220;what do I want to live any <i>other</i> place fer?
<i>Mace</i> is what I want&#8211;just Mace. And, say!
you take back you&#8217; little ole crick-bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got more land&#8217;n I want <i>now.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss,&#8221;&#8211;I helt out my hand&#8211;&#8220;here&#8217;s where
you git a new son-in-law, and a foreman fer
keeps on cow-punch pay. Shake!&#8221;</p>

<p>He give one hand to Mace, and he give me
the other. &#8220;Not by a long shot, Cupid!&#8221; he says.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I git a half-<i>pardner.</i>&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>So here I am&#8211;settled down at the ole Bar Y.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>
And it&#8217;d take a twenty-mule team t&#8217; pull me
offen it. Of a evenin&#8217;, like this, the boss, he sits
on the east porch, smokin&#8217;; the boys &#8217;re strung
along the side of the bunk-house t&#8217; rest and gass
and laugh; and, out yonder, is the cottonwoods,
same as ever, and the ditch, and the mesquite,
leveler&#8217;n a floor; and&#8211;up over it all&#8211;the moon,
white and smilin&#8217;.</p>

<p>Then, outen the door nigh where the sun-flowers
&#8217;re growin&#8217;, mebbe she&#8217;ll come&#8211;a slim,
little figger in white. And, if it&#8217;s plenty warm,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
